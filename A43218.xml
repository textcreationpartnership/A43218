            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The King was yet at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoſs <hi>Caracena</hi> Governour for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> uſed the ſame Grandeurs of Honour to him, as are redevable to Soveraign Princes, but in a more ſincere and opener way than is uſual with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</hi> Much Diſcourſe there was in <hi>England,</hi> that his Majeſty would have been ſtopped in thoſe Provinces by the Rebel-Phanaticks: this aroſe from his Majeſties frequent Journeys to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and back to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> as if that were his utmoſt limit; but nothing was ſo far diſtanced from the honourable demeanour of that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Court, who with all imaginable civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties humbly took their leaves, the chief Perſons of the Nobility attending on him as far as his Majeſty would ſuffer them, in his way, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a greater privacy than their preſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects would admit.</p>

            <p>On the Seventh of the ſame Moneth, the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mordant,</hi> newly then created to that Dignity, arrived there, with full aſſurances that the Members who were then elected to ſerve for the enſuing Parliament, which was to ſet down on the 25th. then inſtant, were honeſt Patriots, and well affected to his Majeſty, and that they would labour indubitably for the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, aſſoon as it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and that their ſitting down would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly commence the day prefixed and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>From that time forward, there paſſed not a day almoſt, that the King received not ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable News, upon which he might ground infallible hopes of his Reſtauration.

He was brought back to his former Priſon, the Tower, and there better ſecured, and ſince removed to the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey.</hi> The King received the ſame day Letters from General <hi>Montagne,</hi> then riding in the <hi>Downs,</hi> which aſſured him of the good eſtate of the Affaires of the Kingdom, and of the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Intentions, of which he had already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Proofs many moneths before, when S. <hi>George Boeth</hi> took up Arms for the King in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now his Majeſty thought it time to appear to his People,
<note place="margin">The Kings Letters and Declarations to Parliament, and Army and City.</note> from out of that obſcurity wherein his hard Fortunes had ſo long while concealed him; which he did with ſuch a ſudden Brightneſs, that ſtruck Joy and Chearſulneſs into the Eyes and Faces of all his Subjects. For preſently he ſent away the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mordant,</hi> and Sr. <hi>John Greenvile</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> with his Declaration and Letters, dated from this place to the 2 Houſes, and the Lord Mayor and Common Council of the ſaid City, and the General and Officers of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55537:17"/>the Army, who arrived ſoon after the ſitting down of the Parliament, and on the 2 of <hi>May,</hi> delivered them to the Speakers. That Sacred Name of the King, which not long time was the averſion and abhorrence of baſe mechanick fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and Phanaticks, was heard with venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inſpired into that Illuſtrious Aſſembly, ſuch extraordinary and advantageous motions for the King, that it is impoſſible to expreſs them. It will be enough for the honour thereof to ſay, that whereas not above 3 or 4 moneths before, it had been a Crime of High Treaſon to ſpeak in Parliament in behalf of the King, no ſooner now is that great name pronounced, than a general Joy appeared in the countenances of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and moſt high and dutiful Reſpects for that Divine Character. By Vote of the Houſes therefore Sr. <hi>John</hi> is deſired to enter; the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers receive the Kings Letters from his hand, the Clerk read them, every one in the mean time with the greateſt expreſſive ſubmiſſion in the world, ſtanding bare-headed.</p>
            <p>His majeſty had thereunto, as before ſaid, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a moſt excellent Declaration, for the ſafety and repoſe of thoſe who cortur'd in their thoughts for having partaken in the Rebellion, might fear the puniſhment of it, and in that fear might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the tranquility of the State, and the calling in of their Lawful Prince.</p>
            <p>There never was ſeen a more perfect Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of all the moſt excellent natural Quilities, and of all the vertues, as well Royal as Chriſtian, where with a great Prince may be endowed, than
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55537:17"/>was found in thoſe two wonderful Productions, as was evident in their acceptance and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were full of Piety and Zeal for the Glory of God, and for Religion, of tenderneſs towards the Afflictions of his People, Eſteem for the Parliament, Firmneſs for the Conſervation of his own Rights, an admirable Prudence for the regulating of Affairs, and an inexemplar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct for the re-eſtabliſhing of the Government in its former ſtate, Love for the good, indulgence for the ſeduced, and a more than Chriſtian Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency for Criminals, or rather for Crime it ſelf; for a Crime, I ſay, ſo black, and ſo abominable, that as there was not an Example of it in Hiſtory, ſince the Creation of the world, ſo his Majeſty hath not altogether been ſo wrought upon by his innate Goodneſs, as to let it paſs for an example unpuniſhed to Future Ages.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Papers wrought the Effect which the King promiſed himſelf from them, ſince they abſolutely gained the hearts of the people, which the miſeries of the time paſt had already very much diſpoſed to the acknowledging their Prince: For they were no ſooner read, but the Parliament declared, that the Tenders and Sentiments of the King, were Gracious, Good, and Generous, and Conformable to the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, the Government whereof ought to confiſt of King, Lords and Commons; and forthwith ordered, that moſt humble Thanks ſhould be returned to his Majeſty, for the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Letters and Declarations aforeſaid, and that for a preſent ſupply of his Majeſties occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55537:18"/>and in order to ſpeed his Return, the ſum of fifty thouſand Pounds was appointed for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to which the City of <hi>London</hi> added ten thouſand more. They likewiſe ordered, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Montague</hi> ſhould ſayl with his Fleet to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Kings Pleaſure on the Coaſts of <hi>Holland.</hi> That the Two Houſes and City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould ſend Commiſſioners reſpectively from them, to beſeech him to come and take poſſeſſion of his Kingdoms, which God, and his Right had given him; and that in the mean time, Sr. <hi>John Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> ſhould be diſparched with the Parliaments Anſwer, and ſhould carry to <hi>Brada</hi> the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Prayers of the Two Houſes, or rather the impatience, which the Nation had to ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain their Natural Soveraign, after a ſad abſence of many calamitous and miſerable years.</p>
            <p>But that which was moſt remarkable in theſe Reſolutions, was, that they were not taken after a long conteſtation, conſult or diſpure; nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſimple acquieſcement of the Parliament in a major Vote, but by the expreſs Suffrages and Votes upon the univerſal and unanimous conſent of all the Members of both Houſes, who ſtrove in aeleg;mulation of each other, which ſhould give the greateſt Proof of Affection. The Parliament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gave Liberty to the Noble General, to ſend Mr. <hi>Clarges,</hi> now Sr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> being Knighted by the King at <hi>Breda,</hi> his Brother in Law, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome Gentlemen, to aſſure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Fidelity and Obedience of the Army, of which, upon the communicating of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Letters and Declaration aforeſaid, they

In the mean while the States of <hi>Holland</hi> pretending, that it would take no effect, until they ſhould have notice of the Declaration of Parliament, not that they doubted of its Intention, but becauſe they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it imported the Service of the King, ſo to uſe it, as not to prevent the Parliament, and do any thing raſhly in an Affair of that conſequence, Civility done out of ſeaſon, being incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unproſitable; but becauſe it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that his Majeſty ſhould know the good Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the States, they ſo ordered, that the King ſhould have aſſurances thereof under-hand; &amp; to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55537:20"/>this purpoſe the Lord <hi>Beverweert</hi> the Governour of the <hi>Boſch,</hi> a principal Perſon, was pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being alſo akin to the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi>'s Alliance with his Houſe, and for his particular reſpects for the King during his Troubles: All conſiderations which might oblige him to ſee the King, before he appeared in the quality of a publick Miniſter.</p>
            <p>He arrived at <hi>Breda</hi> the 5th. of <hi>May,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted his Commiſſion ſo happily, that the King reſerving but the open Declaration of his Good Will for the Deputies when they ſhould be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, was very well pleaſed with his Addreſs, which proved of great moment both to the States,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniard</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to paſs through his Provinces.</note> and Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Beverweert:</hi> for <hi>Don John de Monroy</hi> arrived the ſame day at <hi>Breda,</hi> and prayed his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty from the Marqueſs <hi>Caracena,</hi> to take his way through <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to embirk in one of the Ports of thoſe Quarters to return to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, aſſuring the King for the better induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as he paſſed, the Arrears of thoſe Troops, which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> entertained for his Majeſty, being ready at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> ſhould be paid them, but this appeared no more than what paſſed in the Conference, which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had ſome daies before with the Marqueſs <hi>Caracena</hi> himſelf, in the Town of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> by Order of the King, who would not go there in perſon, though he was preſſed thereunto through the conſideration of the Important Affairs which he ſaid he had to communicate to his Majeſty.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55537:21"/>The King excuſed himſelf with the ſame firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now from the Civilities which he ſent to be made unto him, by refuſing him upon the facility which he found for his paſſage where he was preſent. Among other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his complying with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Requeſt, (not to ſpeak of any hazard of detention of his Perſon, if he ſhould have returned by the way of <hi>Flanders,</hi> without certain Articles or Conditions to be ſigned by him there) two appeared to be the chiefeſt; 1. Becauſe of the number of the Commiſſioners from the Parliament, who were ſaid to bring with them a Train of 400 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, beſides Domeſticks, which muſt needs ſpend time in going from the Sea to <hi>Breda:</hi> and the other, the Court was already ſo great and full, and the Town ſo ſtreightened, and unfurniſhed of Proviſions, that it would be impoſſible to lodge them all there, and the weather being hot, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not Victuals to be brought from other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places.</p>
            <p>So real and ſo permanent an Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did the States think the Preſence, and their entertainment of the King to be, that becauſe of avoyding all diſputes for precedency, which each Province challengeth in its own Countrey, ſo that they ſuffer not the Generality to have other advantage in the Provinces, than that which is due unto them by vertue of their Union, and not to give the King any diſpleaſure by their diſorder in his reception, they reſolved of a courſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that Province which was at the moſt coſt, might be taken notice of accordingly. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55537:21"/>of <hi>Holland</hi> therefore, who had cauſed the King to be prayed in particular to honour their Province with his Preſence, would have him to be received and ſaluted in their Name upon the Frontier, and would defray the Charges on his way, from the time he entred into their Province, and till the firſt day he ſhould arrive at the <hi>Hague,</hi> as making part of his Voyage: The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates General, who repreſent not indeed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but what every Province poſſeſſeth in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, left to the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> all the marks of Soveraignty, and conſented to this, that their deputies after they had congratulated the King, &amp; conducted his Majeſty to the entrance of <hi>Holland</hi> ſhould remain in the quality of private perſons, on condition notwithſtanding that the Deputies of <hi>Holland</hi> ſhould give the Honour of the Houſe, and give them precedence in the places where they ſhould meet together. So nice and ſtrict were they upon the punctilio in this Affair, from whence they had deſigned themſelves Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Renown, which, if ſo famous to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, could not but be infinitely honourable to the Illuſtrious Receiver.</p>
            <p>The Eſtates General for their part of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, reſolved that ſame day, that the Kings Charges ſhould be defrayed during the whole time he ſtayed in the United Provinces, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained likewiſe Proviſion to be made according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which though they met with many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they at laſt abundantly performed as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>

               <hi>Sir, It is now the third time that my Lords, the States of</hi> Holland <hi>have congratulated with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty upon the coming to the Crown. The firſt was, when you attained thereunto by the Fundamental Law of your Eſtate, immediately after the Deceaſe of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55537:24"/>the Late King, your Father, of moſt Glorious and Eternal Memory; and the other, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from the Committee of Eſtates and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of</hi> Scotland <hi>came to this Place to invite your Majeſty to go and take poſſeſſion of one of the Crowns of your Anceſtors. It is but with great grief, that we remember thoſe two diſaſtrous Encounters; but on the contrary, it is with a transport of Joy that we are now to congratulate your Majeſty upon the preſent happy ſtate of your Affairs; and this with ſo much the more reaſon, as they know that the reciprocal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between</hi> England <hi>and this Republick hath never ſuffered the leaſt alteration under the Government of her Kings.</hi> The reſt was like that of the States General, and concluded with the like Invitation of his Majeſty to make his Court in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, proteſting all thankfulneſs for the Honour done them, if he pleaſed to accept thereof. The King returned an Anſwer near the ſame he gave before, and uſed the Deputies with the ſame ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities as the other, entring into a Diſcourſe with them concerning the Northern Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> for the latter of whom he openly declared himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is high time now to caſt an eye into <hi>England,</hi> where, on the aforeſaid 8th. of <hi>May,</hi> the King was Proclaimed in great State, and more than uſual Solemnity: The Copy of which Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation here follows, for that as the Occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, it was drawn up in an unuſual Form.</p>

            <p>Both ſides of the Streets were guarded by the <hi>Militia</hi> Forces of <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> to the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> and ſtood all with their ſwords drawn; as alſo the Officers, and ſeveral ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in Windows. The City Horſe fell in next the Life-guard, then the Lord Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, after whom the Heralds and the reſt, as formerly. When they came to <hi>Chancery</hi> Lane end, they proclaimed his Majeſty a third time, where at the Word <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second in the Proclamation, the King at Arms lifting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up with more than ordinary cheerfulneſs, and expreſſing it with a very audible voyce, the people preſently took it, and on a ſudden carried it to the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> which was purſued with ſuch ſhouts, that near a quarter of an hour was ſpent before ſilence could be made to read the reſt of the Proclamation. After this they went to <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> where his Majeſty was Proclaimed a fourth time, where the ſhouts of the people were ſo great, that though all the Bells in the City rung; <hi>Bow</hi> Bels could not be heard there. Thence to the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> where his Majeſty was again Proclaimed, and the Solemnity ended. The Shouts and Acclamations of the People to this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55537:27"/>gallant and well ordered Proceſſion, are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be expreſt. The numberleſs number of Bonefires, the Ringing of Bels, and ſhooting off the Guns, and the joyful Expreſſions of the People did declare them beyond the Art of any Pen.</p>
            <p>The infected Herd of the Vulgar did hereby purifie and cleanſe the Ayr of <hi>London,</hi> diſpelling thoſe dark Miſts of the Rebellion with the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Applauſes and rejoycing at this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. Nor could a leſs Atonement acquit the frantick multi ude from their mad Tumults, and their former Riot, at that very Croſs: So that the Kings felicity conſiſted not only in redeeming them from Slavery, but reſtoring them to their ſenſes, &amp; the happy uſe thereof, by the Magick of his excellent Name. The whole Solemnity was concluded with Boneſires at every door almoſt, &amp; congratulation of Friends and Acquaintance (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtrangers were ſuch then, ſo great the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mens minds) concerning this happy and long deſired Revolution.

At this time the martyred Kings Statue was re-erected at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and the Arms of the Commonwealth every where pull'd down and defaced, and his Majeſties ſet in their places; as likewiſe reſtored to their former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Churches and Courts of Judicature, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The King took Coach after this Audience, and betwixt eleven and twelve of the Clock came to <hi>Marvaert.</hi>

After ſome Addreſſes and ſhort Salutations, he proceeded to the end of the Cauſey or Dike, where they had made a Bridge from the Dike to the Pinnace, to facilitate his Embarquement.</p>
            <p>For that ſplendid Occaſion, they (as formerly they uſed to do for a Coach to conduct Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors) requeſted the Pinnace or Barge of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

But the King having view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and ſome others, choſe one, which by his former uſe of it (as delighting much to paſs by water) he knew commodious, and becauſe that of the Princeſſes was not great enough to lodge the King and the Princeſs Royal of <hi>Orange,</hi> who would paſs the night by the King her Brother, with perſons neceſſary for their Service.</p>
            <p>That Barge was formerly made for the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> and was the biggeſt of the Fleet which conſiſted of thirty great Barges, beſides innumerable other Barks, called Yachts, a kind of little Frigots.

            <p>This gave occaſion to one of the Deputies, Mr. <hi>de Vlooſwick</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to tell the King that lately they had made one in their Town of the ſame bigneſs, at leaſt as commodious every way, which he took the liberty to offer to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The King neither accepted nor declined, ſo that Order was privately ſent to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to make it ready, and gild it with curious Paintings inſide and outſide, which at his going away, was preſented to him, and is now the Brigandine his Majeſty uſeth on the River.</p>
            <p>The Diſtribution of the other Yachts to the Lords and their Retinue,

<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>York</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral.</note> The King therefore in this occaſion ordained, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould perform the Office of Admiral, in conſigning the Yachts under his Authority, and in his Preſence, ſo that his Royal Highneſs gave himſelf the Yacht of the Princeſs Dowager of <hi>Orange.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> had that of the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> the Princeſs Royal to attend her, one of the Yachts of the Council of State.

            <p>I inſiſt the longer upon this Naval Story, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe never any ſuch thing happened before in <hi>Holland:</hi> there is a Character of that Nation, that they dwell upon the Waters, and certainly it was verified here; ſuch a multitude of them for ſome daies together plying up and down in their boats, in the Kings intended way. But to proceed;</p>
            <p>The King intended to dine at Noon, aſſoon as he came on Board, and the Meat was ready, but the Wind was ſo ſtrong, and the Water ſo topping, that the Princeſs Royal not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the toſſing of the Veſſel, loſt her Appetite, and being Sea-ſick, was forced to lie on her Bed. Thereupon the King deſired to know of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if there was no ſhelter under ſome riſing ground to eaſe her a little; which he anſwering to the contrary, but that they might arrive at <hi>Dort</hi> ſpeedily, they proceeded; and about 4 in the Afternoon came in ſight of that Town. The Rampart and Key were border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Citizens in Arms,
<note place="margin">The King ſaluted as he paſſed by <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </note> and with a Battery of great Guns,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55537:33"/>which made many Peals, as well as the Muskets, whilſt the Fleet paſſed there, during and after the Repaſt which was taken in ſight of the town: yea ſo long as they could diſcover the Flag of the Ship which carried the Perſon of the King, and that which carried the Dukes, they continued the Thunder.</p>
            <p>The Fleet ſtopped a mile beyond the Town, with deſign to caſt Anchor that Evening, and to ſtay the whole night following at the mouth of the River of <hi>Leck:</hi> But there fell out two things which cauſed the King to change his Reſolution. The firſt was, the return of Sr. <hi>John Greenvile,</hi> who arrived from <hi>England</hi> whilſt the King was at Dinner, and related what the Parliament had delivered to him in the Houſe of Commons, and reſolved to beſeech his Majeſty to come to take poſſeſſion of the Crown without any condition or reſerve; and that Admiral <hi>Montague</hi> was then under ſayl with a Fleet to come to receive him in <hi>Holland,</hi> and tranſport him to his Kingdom. The other was, an Advertiſement which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty received almoſt at the ſame time, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that that ſame Fleet appeared that Morning in ſight of <hi>Scheveling,</hi> and at Nine of the Clock had caſt Anchor in the Road, about a mile and an half from the Shore.</p>
            <p>This News the King preſently imparted to Monſieur <hi>Beverweert,</hi> being chief in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and cauſed the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to tell him, who was in perſon in the Deputies Yacht, which joyned ſide by ſide with his, that he confeſſed he made not account
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55537:33"/>to arrive at <hi>Delfe</hi> till Noon next day, according as he had appointed the time of his entrance there, and ſo to the <hi>Hague</hi> for his Reception, but that now he had received intelligence which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to change his purpoſe, and to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the hour that he had reſolved on, becauſe it was of the higheſt importance to him to ſpeak with the Officers of the Fleet, ſo that he ſhould be conſtrained to ſayl the whole night, that he might arrive at <hi>Delfe</hi> by break of day; whereof he prayed him to give Advertiſement to the Lords States immediately by an Expreſs, to the end that the Coaches intended for his Reception, might be there preciſely at ſeven of the Clock next Morning.</p>
            <p>Several Difficulties which would happen were remonſtrated by Monſieur <hi>Beverweert</hi> upon this occaſion, becauſe the Poſt would come late and unſeaſonable, when it would be almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make the States to aſſemble; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to comply with the Kings Deſires, and to give him their utmoſt Devoir for his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they would not fayl to advertiſe their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours thereof, ſince they were there only to obey his Majeſty, and to ſerve him. The Duke of <hi>York</hi> replied, that it was through an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity, and with much unwillingneſs, as to their and the States particular, that he did thus, but that he hoped the Lords Deputies would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the eſtate of his Affairs, and ſo oblige the King very much in expediting their Poſt, and in contributing by that means to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Voyage and Embarquement in that preſſing Conjuncture.</p>

            <p>The Letters went away about five a clock in the Afternoon,

But the King having cauſed the Fleet wherein he was, to ſet ſayl aſſoon as the Sun began to appear on the Horizon, came to the Suburbs of <hi>Delfe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deputies could give order to make the Fleet to ſtay at the deſigned place for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:55537:34"/>
            <p>All the Citizens of the Town were in Armes from three of the Clock in the Morning, and a part had their Poſt upon the Key, before the Port where the King was to land: and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the Town came thither with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to do reverence to the King in the Yacht, aſſoon as he underſtood he was arrived, and to beſeech him to do them the Honour to repoſe and refreſh in their Town, whilſt his Majeſty ſhould attend the Deputies of the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but the King excuſed himſelf on the ſtate of Affairs, which was ſo far from permitting him to ſtay by the way, that it had oblig'd him to prevent the Hour which he had taken and appointed for his Reception.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Letters of the Deputies were brought to the <hi>Hague</hi> at Midnight, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the ſtates aſſembled, and cauſed the Orders to be changed which were given for the Kings Reception at 4 of the Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, into others more preſſing, and they ſent word to the Deputies by the ſame Poſt that they might aſſure his Majeſty that they would not fail to receive him at the Hour he had appointed them, or at eight a Clock in the Morning at the furtheſt. And indeed about two of the Clock after Midnight, they cauſed the Drums to beat, to ſummon to Arms the ſix Companies of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and the Regiment of the Guards of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> who all rendezvouzed at ſix of the Clock.</p>
            <p>The Coaches began to file towards <hi>Delf</hi> about ſeven of the Clock in the Morning, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55537:35"/>after the Burgers, who ſtood in Battalia in the great place, and marched towards the way which goes to <hi>Delfe,</hi> and the Souldiers went to take their Poſt, on the <hi>Viverberg</hi> where they made a Guard, even to the Houſe of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> which was prepared to lodge his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Deputies of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> being arrived at <hi>Delfe,</hi> and having ſpoken with thoſe who had complemented the King at <hi>Breda,</hi> and had had the conduct of his Perſon in the voyage, informed his Majeſty of the order they had given for his Entrance, for his Lodging and Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the end that as their intention was wholly to ſubmit to the Will of his Majeſty, they might make that to be changed therein, which might diſpleaſe him. After the King had given them his approbation, and that they had invited the Deputies of the States General to honour this Ceremony with their Preſence, and to take place immediately after the Kings Coach, they gave order that the Coaches ſhould be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a file along the Key of the Suburb.</p>
            <p>After a Complement paſſed to the King in the name of their Superiours, who, they inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, had ſent a Member of each Town in their Province to wait upon him; which Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was done in the Yacht where the King was: His Majeſty preſently landed, and ſeated himſelf in the Coach of the Princeſs Royal, which that day carried all the Royal Family. The King ſate in the midſt with his Siſter, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> ſate before, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in one of the Boots; and aſſoon as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55537:35"/>they were placed, the whole Company began to advance, to enter into the Town of <hi>Delfe.</hi> Here the King ſtayed not according to his firſt Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but paſſed away from his Landing-place, through the Ranks of the Citizens in Arms, who marched more than the ſpace of a Musket-ſhot from the Gates on both ſides his Coach, where they ſtayed and ſaluted his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, whilſt all the Bels rung, and the Artillery thundred from the Bulwarks and Rampires of the Town.</p>
            <p>It was near ten of the Clock when his Majeſty departed thence,
<note place="margin">The King comes to the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </note> and made it eleven when he came at the <hi>Hague.</hi> In the head of the whole Train which met him, marched ſome Trumpets of the Eſtates, clad in their Coats of Crimſon Velvet, embroydered with Gold and Silver. After them came a long File of Officers belonging to the War, of young Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen very gallant, and bravely mounted. Next to that marched a great number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Officers of the Kings Houſe, of the two Dukes, of the Princeſs Royal, and of the Prince of <hi>Aurange.</hi> After them came Monſieur <hi>Wimmenum,</hi> who had attended the King as chief of the Deputation in the quality of Maſter of the Ceremonies, in his Coach, with ſome Lords in it, preceding immediatly that of the Princeſs Royal, which carried his Majeſty. The Deputies of the Eſtates General filled the two firſt after the Kings; thoſe of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> the ſix following, and the other Coaches which in all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55537:36"/>amounted to the number of ſeventy and odd, each having 6 or 4 Horſes, were filled with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Lords.</p>
            <p>It was by the <hi>Dutch</hi> confeſſed, that this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance (ſo much did they fear of falling ſhort of the due Honours to the King) was not made with an extraordinary Pomp and Glory, worthy ſo great a Monarch, but it was impoſſible to make greater Preparations in the time that the King had appointed for it; and even then when they were conſtrained to change in a manner their firſt Orders; which would no doubt have rendred it more Illuſtrious, had it not been for this Change. And yet the Crowd was ſo great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the curioſity of all men to ſee this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Prince, had drawn a great part of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the neighbour Town to this Entrance; that they were conſtrained to go very ſoftly. As ſoon as the firſt Coaches were entred into the Court, and the King alighted, the Deputies of the States General retired, and left the Honour of the Reception and Entertainment that day to the Eſtates of <hi>Holland.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55537:36"/>them all, being followed by the Deputies of <hi>Holland,</hi> who gave him another ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, and left him to his Repoſe at a private Dinner. The Princeſs Royal who had not ſlept that night before, was the firſt that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and obliged the others by her example, to do the like. The Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Dowager of <hi>Holland</hi> followed her; ſo that none ſtaied but the two Dukes, who dined with him. That done, the Toyl of the Journey, and the little reſt he had taken the two former nights, made him deſire to withdraw: And indeed, the States would have made the Musqueteers to forbear ſhooting (who gave continual Volleys) if it had been poſſible to ſmother the univerſal Joy which the whole world would expreſs on this occaſion. For theſe Volleys anſwered thoſe of a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next day the States General (after they had ſent a Nobleman to know of the King what time he would pleaſe to ſpate to receive that duty which they had reſolved to render him, by doing reverence to him in a body) Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> being in the head of them, with their chief military Officers bareheaded before them,

            <p>'Twas obſerved in this Viſit, that the King never offered to be covered, as was thought, to ſhew that he would do ſomthing more for them than he could do for an Ambaſſadour. After this Speech ended, the Lords the Eſtates were conducted in departing from the Audience, by the ſame Lords that received them, and being returned, in their ordinary Hall they ſeparated themſelves.</p>

The difficulties which aroſe here, were taken away by the following Conſiderations: They ſaid, that Ambaſſadours having a general Commiſſion, and not being, as they ſaid, <hi>miſſi ad hoc,</hi> they might, and ought to do that which their Maſters would do if they were preſent in perſon; and ſo being certain that there is no Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> that would not do Civility to the King of <hi>England,</hi> if he ſhould meet him in his Paſſage, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who were in the place could not fail therein alſo, without being wanting to Civility, and to their Duty. Notwithſtanding ſince his Majeſty was not in his Kingdom, he might uſe them as he pleaſed, yet ſo, that although it was in his choyce to admit the Ambaſſadours or not, he could not diſpenſe himſelf of treating with them, according to the dignity of their Character, and of making them to be covered after he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, ſince they might

The reaſon why he was not admitted as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, was, becauſe of the open Wars betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> at that time; though no Acts of Hoſtility paſſed; and the King conſidered m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Parliament having Voted that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdom by the Fundamental Lawes thereof, was veſted in the King and his Parliament; after they had with all Expreſſions of Duty teſtified their Joy of this happy Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ordered ſeveral Commiſſioners to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by Glaſſes out of each Houſe, to go, for the greater ſolemnity and Luſtre of his Majeſties Court, to attend on him in <hi>Holland,</hi> with the deſires of the Parliament for his ſpeedy return to the exerciſe of his Royal Authority.

            <p>The Eſtates of the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> had audience the day before in a very magnificent and ſolemn way, and were diſmiſſed from it with

            <p>But that the King might not be troubled with multitudes of Viſits, every Corporation or Body of ſubordinate Courts purpoſing to demand Audience of him, they forbid them by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; informing them that the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did it comprehenſively for all of them, and that it would be unſeemly to incommodate his Majeſty with ſo many Viſits, ſo that by this means the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden</hi> then in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was put by from their addreſs and Gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

This Order was obſerved in all Repaſts, only in the abſence of the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> the two Princes his Majeſties Brothers ſeparated, and placed themſelves at the two ends of the Table. By this means one could well ſerve all thoſe that were there, becauſe they were all at a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which permitted the Officers to do their Functions and places; as alſo the Deputies of the Eſtates left ſpace enough between the Kings Table and theirs, for the convenrence of thoſe which ſerved the meat before the Royal perſons, putting themſelves at the two ends of the skirt before the King, who would not that the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Table ſhould be ſeparated from his.

But for the Kings Diet it was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; there was a Clark of the Kitchin, for the Broths, another for the Courſes, another for the Paſtry, one for the Roaſt, and one for the meats between the Courſes, every Clark having four Cooks under him for each Service.</p>
            <p>There was a rumour ſpread this day of ſome attempt intended againſt the Kings perſon; 'twas diſcovered by a mean <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who was in danger of his Life for overhearing of it in a private place in the Rampart, from whence coming out, three men eſpied him, who, as he ſaid, ſpoke to one another in bad <hi>French,</hi> theſe words; <hi>That they failed twice becauſe of the great Number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were about him, and ſerved him for Guards; but they would ſo well take their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the two ſides of the Coach, that he ſhould not eſcape them.</hi> He received two ſhots of a Piſtol, but the Fellows upon his calling out, ſled away. Upon his perſiſtance in this Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Guard of Horſe were preſently added to the Foot, a Cornet of whom alwaies ſtood in the avenues of the Palace, where the King was lodged, and of which there was alwaies a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron which followed his Coach whereſoever he went.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:55537:45"/>
            <p>And foraſmuch as it was known that there was found in the Fleet a man bold enough, when the King ſhould come to ſee the Veſſel, where he ſerved as a Mariner, to give fire to the Powder, an Order was made by the General, as he himſelf did, that every Captain ſhould take the Key of the Powder to himſelf. This invited the King to chuſe a Guard of fourſcore Gentlemen, which are now improved into a greater number, under the command of the Lord <hi>Gerard,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Life-guard, which ſerved by ſquadrons; ſo that there was alwaies twenty, which marched on both ſides the Coach, having one hand on the ſupporting ſtaffe of the Boot, and holding a ſword drawn out of the Belt, but in the Scabberd, in the other. But as this Poſture was ſomwhat irregular, and offenſive in a Country where the Perſon of his Majeſty was no leſs dear, than in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the King conſidering that to hinder ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to his Perſon, was ſufficient to ſecure it, would that they ſhould wear their Swords by their ſides, and carry a Cane in their hands, which aſſured the Paſſage, and alſo made their Quality and Charge to be reſpected.</p>

            <p>Somthing muſt be ſaid of that which was remarkable on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 20th.
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hardy</hi> Preacheth before the King at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>May.</hi> The King had appointed that Morning to hear a Sermon, and to that purpoſe it was ordained that Mr. <hi>Hardy</hi> one of the Miniſters which came from <hi>England</hi> with the Commiſſioners of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſhould preach before the King in the Chappel of the Court which ſerves for a Church to the <hi>French</hi> that live at the <hi>Hague,</hi> at eleven of the Clock in the Forenoon, aſſoon as the <hi>French</hi> had ended their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Devotions. And to the end to prevent diſorder amongſt the People which were come there in crouds from the neighbour Towns, the Company which had the Guard, was commanded to ſeize upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennues of the Chappel, and particularly to poſſeſs the door which leads into a little Partition where the Princes of <hi>Aurange</hi> heretofore cauſed a Bench to be made, cloathed with black Velvet, and covered with a Canopy of the ſame Stuffe for themſelves, and for Perſons of Quality that were ordinarily of their train, but they dreamed not to remedy another inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which deceived all the other precautions that they uſed. For the <hi>French</hi> in ſtead of giving place to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and of uſing the civility which they were accuſtomed to have for ſtrangers, would not go out of the Church; ſo greedy and reſolute were they of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55537:51"/>the King, and the manner of his Worſhip and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And even the perſons of Condition which ſate in the little Partition, whereof before, and who were for the moſt part <hi>Dutch,</hi> refuſed to make place for the Lords who were in great number about the Kings Perſon, without conſidering that this very Incivility hindred them abſolutely to ſatisfie the curioſity which they had to ſee the King, and to be preſent at the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Liturgy. The Reader of the Church exhorted the people to withdraw, and likewiſe the Paſtor who made the Sermon, went up again into the Pulpit, and repreſented to them the wrong they did themſelves as well as their Brethren of the ſame Religion, and ſtrangers as they in this Countrey, in obſtinately ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in their Seats after having heard the Word of God, and in fayling in that reſpect to the King, to whom that very Temple was given by their Superiors, and where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were to hear it after them in their own Tongue. But theſe Exhortations made no Impreſſion on ſpirits prepoſſeſſed, no more than the other Reaſons which he alledged, ſo that the King was enforced to do his Devotions in the place where her Royal Highneſs is accuſtomed to have her Preaching; particularly ſince moſt important conſiderations hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her in the time of the Uſurpation to go to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church. Into this place of hers entred as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as it could hold of the Lords of that Nation. The Doctor took his Text in the 26th. Chap. of <hi>Iſaiah, v.</hi> 19. which he applied to the preſent eſtate of the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> and made ſo learned and pathetick Diſcourſe, that there was not any one there who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired not the Doctors Elegancy and Learning, and were not touched and edified therewith.</p>
            <p>After the Liturgy and Sermon were ended, there

Now foraſmuch as this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is done with Circumſtances very remarkable, and different from thoſe which accompany it in <hi>France,</hi> and becauſe this Glory is wholly incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, ſave to that King alone, and becauſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it may be of ſome uſe, as it will much ſatisfie Curioſity, it will not be from the purpoſe to ſpeak here of all the Particulars thereof, ſince it will alſo be an eſſential part of this Relation, which ſhould omit nothing materially honourable to the King during his ſtay at the <hi>Hague,</hi> or his Perſon and Reign hitherto.</p>
            <p>Before we engage in the recital, for the Honour of this Crown, it will be neceſſary to premiſe thus much, that they are deceived which give out or believe that that which the Kings of <hi>Engl.</hi> do on this occaſion, is but becauſe of that pretenſion which they have to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; by vertue of that Title which they take, or from the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> wherewith they charge their Eſcutcheon, that they attribute to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Grace and Gift which is given to the Eldeſt Son of the Church.</p>
            <p>For it is moſt certain that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath this right and advantage, not as King of <hi>France,</hi> though he takes the quality thereof in his Titles, but as King of <hi>England,</hi> and becauſe the Kings his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours have uſed it efficaciouſly ſince the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſour, that is to ſay, 600 years ago, and long before the King of <hi>England</hi> had declared their pretenſions, as they did when <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Ceremony, as in <hi>France</hi> it is done after the King hath communicated in the Morning, ſo was it done here, in the aforeſaid Chappel after Sermon, though the King at home uſeth other places, as the Banquetting Houſe at <hi>Whitehal.</hi> There was here a great Chair placed for the King, in a place ſomwhat diſtant from the people. Aſſoon as the King was ſate, one of the Clerks of the Cloſet ſtood at the right ſide of his Chair, holding on his Arm or in his right hand as many Gold Angels every one tied in a Ribbond of white Silk, as there were ſick to be touched, which were in number fourty eight. But becauſe Angels of Gold which are ſo called, becauſe they have the Figure of an Angel on them, were very rare, he uſed on this preſent occaſion, the ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pieces, which were near of the ſame value. Here; and in this occaſion, Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> the Chaplain of the Princeſs of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> performed the place of the Kings Chaplain, as he did all along before at <hi>Bitda.</hi>

            <p>The Chaplain then read the 16th.

               <hi>Feaſt of the Eſtates of</hi> Holland.</note>
            <p>COme we next to deſcribe that magnificet entertainment which that night the Eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> had invited his Majeſty to, at Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Houſe. The Hall (whoſe Dore is one of the faireſt and moſt coſtly in all <hi>Europe</hi> becauſe it is double, exceeding large and made of a rare <hi>Indian</hi> Wood) was furniſhed but with the ordinary hangings of Crimſon Damask, and had no other adornments but that here and there, there were ſome fair pictures; the ends of the Chimneys and the void place above the Croſſe-Bar-Windows, were adorned with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, wreathes and figures of Trees laden with Oranges and mingled with all ſorts of Flowers, which formed not onely a very regular compart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but wonderfully refreſhed alſo the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and charmed no leſſe the ſmell by their perfume, then they pleaſed the ſight through the diverſity of their Colours.</p>
            <p>From the Center of the Roundel above, glazed about, deſcended low a royal Crown very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly made in the midſt of four Luſtres or Chriſtall Candleſticks, which with many other Candleſticks, Arms of Silver, and the like, gave a moſt glorious light.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55537:53"/>
            <p>It is difficult to deſcribe the manner of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and placing the Tables, both for the terms ſake and the intricacy of the deſign in this Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where convenience was made for the Lords to ſet and Sup; All was encloſed within a baluſtrade that hindered ſtrangers from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling into the preſence. The King firſt took his place under a Cloath of Eſtate of the ſame Crimſon Damask, between the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> on his right hand, and the Princeſſe of <hi>Aurange</hi> on the left, and his Brothers and the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> ſetting as they uſed before. The Kings Table (from whence he could ſee all the Deputies, whoſe Table came from the mideſt of the Kings where they were ſeated according to the ranks, which the Nobles and Towns hold in their Aſſemblies) was ſerved with ſix diſhes in oval Form, and with two more laid a croſſe, the other all loaden like <hi>Pyramids,</hi> the Services being changed five times. There was on the Eſtates Table Twenty eight great diſhes, and many Plate Trenchers, but they changed them no more then four times, to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Table and his Majeſty. All along before This entertainment they ſerved but ſeven Tables with the Kings, beſides the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but this day there were ſixteen, ſeven of which were ſerved as ordinarily in the other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of the Kings Houſe, and the reſt in the Coſtellary, where expreſſe order was given to receive and treat all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that ſhould come. The expence of this entertainment was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55537:53"/>not particularly known, by reaſon the States would not make any brags of their Coſt, but the King was greatly pleaſed with the magnificence thereof, as he expreſſed himſelf to one of the States the next day, affirming that he never Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped better then the day he arrived at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and that in all the feaſts which were made as well in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the Low-Countreys, and among others, that which the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopoldus</hi> made in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1656. when he was going out of the Low-Countreys into <hi>Germany,</hi> he ſaw nothing come near that wherewith the ſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> had now entertained him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Eſtates began to drink the Kings Health, they gave the ſignall with a Torch at one of the Windows which looked towards the <hi>Viver</hi> where the Artillery was placed, which preſently was fired, to which anſwerd the Muſquet and the Carbines of the Horſe, and the Cannon from the <hi>Rampart,</hi> and this at four ſeveral times, which was as the intermedial Muſick of that which paſſed in the Palace during ſupper, whilſt it laſted there was made to come forth from a boat which was in the midſt of that viver or pond, which waſheth the Foot of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Houſe aſwel as o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 21. the States having notice that the King intended to depart in his voyage
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55537:54"/>the day following, deſired to know how they ſhould wait upon him, to make him their laſt complement either in body or by Deputies. But the King to do them an extraordinary honour in recompence of thoſe great civilities he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them, acquainted them by a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his own, that the next day his voyage being deferred till <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> he would make them a viſit in perſon in the place of their Aſſembly. They would have been glad if they could have diſpenſed themſelves from receiving ſo great an honour, but they choſe to be loaden with civility at home, then to commit an incivility in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the will of the King. The Eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> likewiſe, to whom the King ſignified by one of the Secretaries of his Commands that he would do them the ſame honour, received the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof with the ſame reſpect; and both one and t'other after they had agreed with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Court how they intended to receive his Majeſty, with all the ſubmiſſion they ſhould be able to render to ſo good a Prince and ſo great Monarch, they both gave neceſſary orders in their ſeveral Aſſemblies for this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and illuſtrious viſit.</p>

It was thought neceſſary by the Kings Councill to diſengage the Officers and Marriners of the Oath which they had taken to the laſt Parliament, and to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereof by a new Oath of Fidelity to the King their Soveraign Lord. The Duke being received with extraordinary honour and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cauſed the Captains of the other Ships to come aboard him and take the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, which the Captains cauſed afterwards to be adminiſtred to the inferiour Officers, and to all the reſt of the Sea-men in the other Ships. The Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> had cauſed the Flag wherein were the States Arms, to be changed before he departed from the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and made the Arms thereof in the ſtern to be defaced and pulled down, but reſerved the Honour for his Royal Highneſſe to change the name of the Ship, which <hi>Cromwell</hi> had cauſed to be called the <hi>Naſeby,</hi> in memory of that fatal place where the King deceaſed received his totall overthrow: who thinking no name great enough for ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe a ſtructure (being certainly one of the

            <p>It will not be amiſſe to ſet down a little breif of the Dukes entertainment here; he dined in that Chamber or Gallery where the King was to lodge, which was all new wainſcotted and guilded, and furniſhed with a fair bed of the fineſt Cloth of <hi>England,</hi> fringed with Gold and Silver, the Floor laid with <hi>Turky</hi> Tapeſtry. In the Generals Kitchen there were ſix Clerks that laboured but for the mouth, his Table being as well ſerved at Sea as many Princes were in their Dominions: The diſhes which were all of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were of ſo vaſt a bigneſſe, moſt of them, that Surloines of Beef and Chines likewiſe were ſerved up in them. The Duke dined at this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary of the Generals, which might paſſe for a great feaſt, and in going thence was ſaluted with the Artillery of the whole Fleet, which did him the ſame Honour when he came on board. At this time the King received letters from the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> full of impertinences and menaces againſt him if he protected not their Sect and entred not alſo into thoſe thoughts.</p>

            <p>THis was meerly procured from the King to do him greater Honour, for that not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to get a Copy of his Speech which they would have recorded, they find this way to be ſure of a parcell of it under his own hand: a Copy whereof being therefore tranſmitted to the Eſtates General, was inſerted in the Regiſters of the Reſolutions of the Generality and of the Province of <hi>Holland, in perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> and to manifeſt their readineſſe of complying with the King in all things.</p>

               <hi>Monſieur de Thou</hi> Count of <hi>Meſlay</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour had this day his Audience of leave with the ſame Ceremonies as he was received at
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55537:59"/>firſt; ſo likewiſe had the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and from him they went to viſit the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> as Cheif of the Commiſſioners from the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours had cauſed the King to be ſounded, if he were pleaſed that they ſhould ſee the Commiſſioners of the two houſes, to which queſtion his Majeſty expreſſed himſelf, that they ſhould do him a pleaſure therein. They had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often cauſed Audience to be asked of both Commiſſioners, but their continual imployments on the Kings perſon, joyned to the difficulty there was to aſſemble perſons that diverted themſelves in a place where occaſions of their entertainment were not wanting to them, and in a time when all the world rejoyced, oppoſed alwayes their ſatisfaction therein. Only the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> endeavoured what he could to make the Commiſſioners of the Higher houſe to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but to no purpoſe. They prayed therefore at laſt the one and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> audience of the lower Houſe with my Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who had aſſembled ſome of them in the houſe of the Baron of <hi>Aſperen</hi> where he was lodged; and the next day which was <hi>Tueſday</hi> the day before the Kings imbarking, the Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi> did as much, receiving them at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſero</hi> Secretary of the Council to the Prince of <hi>Aurange.</hi> They were civilly entertained from the Conſideration of the reſpect the King had ſhewed them, but as to their affairs, my Lord told them, that the King for the future was to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55537:59"/>have the ſole diſpoſition of ſuch matters, ſince that in returning to his Kingdomes, the ſole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the State appertained and was remitted to him.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> did now likewiſe complement the King upon his departure from himſelf, and alſo officiated for the Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to both of whom the K. profeſſed a very great affection, to the Prince, for his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſidence and other Civilities ſhewed him at his houſe; to the Duke, for thoſe Teſtimonies of that kindneſſe he had for his affairs, when all the world believed them deſperate, and further ſaid, that he would conſerve eternally the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the good offices which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had rendred him in the Empire, and of the great obligations which he laid upon him in a time, when there was no Prince almoſt, that dared to declare for his Intereſts. <hi>Monſieur Coyet</hi> Ambaſſadour from the <hi>Swede,</hi> becauſe he would not be troubleſome to the King in this diſpatch for <hi>England,</hi> contented himſelf to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to his Majeſty, that his Maſter would ſend an Ambaſſadour extraordinary to complement him together for all his felicities upon his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But the Eſtates General who had received an Honour by the Kings preſence in their Aſſembly,

If your Majeſty finds not in their faces the ſame cheerfulneſſe which you might obſerve there, when they had the Honour to ſalute you at your Arrival, it is becauſe of the ſorrow to ſee themſelves ready to be deprived of the Splendour of ſo fair a light, which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath made to ſhine in their Eſtate during the little time you would remain there.

            <p>The eſtates being retired, after the King had thanked them for their manifold civilities they had done him, His Majeſty employed the reſt of the day in taking his leave by viſits deſigned to that purpoſe. The firſt he made was to the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> where he ſtayed not long, thence to the Houſe of the Princeſſe Dowager of <hi>Orange,</hi> where he found alſo the Princeſſe of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and the young Lady of <hi>Aurange</hi> her Daughters. The time and diſcourſe paſt here, was not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental but of affairs of State, (of which that Princeſſe is very capable) and of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Europe and of the intereſt of it's ſeveral Princes, of whoſe Eſtates ſhe hath a moſt perfect knowledge: After this viſit performed ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducted the King to the place where ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him and retired not till ſhe ſaw the King gone.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:55537:61"/>
            <p>The next viſit was beſtowed on the Princeſſe Royal, who preſented him many perſons either to recommend to him or to take leave. He ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her till ſupper time at which time the Waggons were employed from the eſtates to carry his Baggage to <hi>Scheveling</hi> which was preſently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued; and then he returned to his Lodgings.</p>
            <p>At evening the Chief of the Deputies of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> took occaſion from the reſpects the King ſaid he had for that Province, for the teſtimonies of affection which they had ſhewed to him, to ſay to his Majeſty, that the intention of the Lords eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> was to do ſomething more if there were any Rarities in their Eſtate that might be preſented to ſo great a Prince. Notwithſtanding that they would give themſelves the liberty to cauſe him to be accommodated, and to ſend him on the firſt occaſion ſome preſents, which they would beſeech his Majeſty to conceive as proofs of their good will rather then of their power. The King would have declined it, ſaying that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other aſſurances of their affection, then thoſe they had given him at this preſent occaſion, that he was already ſatisfied therewith, and thank'd them not onely for the effects paſſed, but alſo for the good will they expreſſed unto him for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Thoſe preſents which they intended for him were not yet ready, becauſe the bed of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe Royal was not perfect, which was to make a part of them, and becauſe they knew not yet what his Majeſty would like moſt. No more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55537:62"/>therefore then was ſaid to his Majeſty; but the Eſtates having reſolved what they would preſent to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the ſame Lord acquainted his Highneſſe that the Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> willing to give ſome marks of affection to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, had ſought every where for ſomething that might be worthy of him, and that having found nothing becauſe of the ſhortneſſe of reſidence, would not permit them to make enquiry, yet that his Highneſſe might not depart without ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſentiment of their ſubmiſſe reſpects to him, they prayed him to accept a bill of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer of Seventy five thouſand Guilders, which makes ſterling Seven thouſand five hundred pounds, which he might cauſe his Treaſurer to receive either at preſent in this Town, of Mr. <hi>Berchel</hi> Receiver General of the Province, or at <hi>London,</hi> or elſewhere, and it ſhould be payed at ſight. The Duke received the Bill with many Teſtimonies of acknowledgement, and ſaid that it was without any repugnance or reluctancy that he charged himſelf with this obligation towards the Lords the eſtates. The like preſent and ſum was tendred in a Bill to the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who alſo received it very kindly. They had deſigned alſo a preſent of Four hundred pounds for my Lord <hi>Crofts</hi> who brought the eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> into the Audience of the King, but as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Kings Preſent ſo did they alter this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, ſtaying while a Chain of Gold of that value could with all poſſible ſpeed and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be made.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:55537:62"/>
            <p>The dayes were now almoſt at their full length, and yet it may be ſaid that not onely the <hi>Hague</hi> ſaw <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23. of <hi>May</hi> ſomething more early then the Sun, but alſo that there was in a manner, no night between <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Wedneſday</hi> particularly for thoſe, who finding no Nooke or Hole to put their heads in (becauſe the Houſes were not able to Contain the people who flocked thither from all parts of the Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) for the moſt part were conſtrained to walk the Streets.</p>
            <p>There was no night for more then fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons, who from that <hi>Tueſday</hi> evening were gone to take up their places on the Downs or Sand hills which border on the Sea along the coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> from whence they might diſcover the Fleet and ſee the King to Embark. The Trumpet awakened the Horſe that were to attend the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of his Majeſties departure before day; and at two a clock in the morning the Drums beat to aſſemble as well the Citizens as Souldiers. In the Kings houſe it ſelf every one was employed the whole night in cauſing the reſt of the Baggage to be loaden and ſent away, and there was ſeen nothing but Waggons and Coaches full of <hi>Engliſh</hi> who went to embark themſelves before the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ks appointed for his Majeſties Service were poſſeſſed by his Domeſtick people and Servants who were to attend upon his perſon.</p>
            <p>The Citizens came together at their ordinary Rendezvous of the <hi>Viverberg,</hi> and the Regiment of the guards in the outer Court, both of which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55537:63"/>marched from thence to <hi>Scheveling,</hi> where they ſtood in Battalia on the Sea ſhore, from both ſides of the Battery of the Cannon which was brought thither from the <hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The king himſelf was very early and ſoon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and received the complements of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons that would do him reverence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> who had deſired the favour of their laſt audience juſt at his departure. They met at their hall as at their firſt viſit and thence to the Kings houſe, where all the Lords and perſons of Quality about his Majeſty came to meet them and conducted them to the preſence Chamber, where the chief of them <hi>Mounſieur de Witt</hi> ſpoke this moſt elegant Harange, which far ſurpaſſed all the reſt.

            <p>To this Speech the King returned in his uſual civility, repeating the great obligations they had ſaid upon him, which he ſaid he would convert into a ſtrict alliance and perfect underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them as ſoon as his eſtate was compoſed. When this complement was over which the King expected, he took his way to the Princeſſe Royal her appartment, whom he would viſit at home before he took horſe; whither the Lords States would needs conduct him, and by reaſon they were uncovered he would not put on his hat in the going thither: when he was come to the Chamber the ſaid Lords retired, to take Coach when the ſaw the King ready to take horſe.</p>
            <p>The converſation which his Majeſty had with the Princeſſe was but a moment, for immediately after, he went thence and came down into the Court of the Palace, where he mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55537:66"/>Caſtle of the Poop and received his Majeſty (with the greateſt ſubmiſſion that could be rendred to a Prince) at the Top of the Stairs by which he aſcended to the Ship. The King again rendred him all the teſtimonies of goodneſſe and affection that could be imagined or expected from a Soveraign who acknowledged perfectly the important Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had done him, as having been one of the moſt powerful inſtruments of his reeſtabliſhment, whereof he had given him Aſſurances long before; and a moſt certain proof, when he departed from the <hi>Sound</hi> (preſently after <hi>Richards</hi> diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whither he was ſent to aſſiſt the <hi>Swede,</hi> under pretence to mediate between the Dane and that Nation) upon his Majeſties Orders to favour the deſign of Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> who then was in Arms for his Majeſty under the fair pretence of a Free Parliament.</p>
            <p>It was paſt eleven a clock when the King ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Fleet, ſo that as ſoon as his Majeſty, was but a little diſengaged of a part of thoſe that would follow him on board, he ſate down at a Table in the great Gallery with the other Royal perſons, while ſome other of his Lords and others great ones of <hi>Holland</hi> were entertained in other appartments. In the Kings paſſage the two dayes at Sea the General expended above two thouſand pounds, though the Lords the Eſtates had provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Ship and the Reſt of the Fleet with all kind of neceſſary refreſhments and proviſions beyond what needed for ſo ſhort paſſage.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55537:66"/>
            <p>After Dinner was ended, the King received again the laſt complements of ſome particular perſons, expreſſing great civility to the Deputies of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> for whom the Leiutenant Admirall <hi>Waſſenaer</hi> made the Speech, and ſent them away with new proteſtations of affection and Amity.</p>
            <p>The Sea was calm and the heaven ſo clear, that the King had a deſire to diſcover once again a Country, where he had received ſo many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of reſpect and love. To this purpoſe to take his full and laſt view thereof, he aſcended to the top of the poop, and ſeeing the people with which he had left the <hi>Downes</hi> covered remaining there ſtill, he was pleaſed to acknowledge <hi>that it was impoſſible his own Subjects could have more tenderneſſe for him then thoſe people, on whoſe</hi> Affections <hi>he perceived he reigned no leſſe, then he was going to reign on the</hi> Wills <hi>of the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
            <p>After this, he embraced the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> with the ſame tenderneſs as he could have had for his own Son, and gave him his Bleſſing; and took leave of the Queen of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> But when he was to depart from the princeſs Royal his Siſter; that Princeſſe who had with ſo much courage and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grief almoſt, looked all paſt misfortunes in the Face, and who had vertue enough to fortifie that of her Brothers, needed now all his conſtancy to reſolve her ſelf to ſuffer this ſeparation which ſhe had wiſhed with ſo much impatience, and whoſe conſequences were to be ſo glorious to them both.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55537:67"/>The King himſelf who had reſolution enough ſo as to ſhow no weakneſſe in his greateſt misfortunes, could not reſiſt the tears of a Siſter, whom many other conſiderations as ſtrong as thoſe of Birth render'd extremely dear unto him. She would have been comfortleſſe amidſt ſo many joyes, but for the hopes ſhe had again ſhortly to ſee the King her Brother in his Kingdome. The former mutuall endearments between them were alwayes ſo paſſionate and ſincere, that much adoe there would have been to diſengage her from the Arms of his Majeſty, if the General had not cauſed the Anchors to be weighed and the ſignal to be given the Fleet.</p>
            <p>The Royal <hi>Charles</hi> newly ſo Chriſtened was now under ſail for <hi>England,</hi> when the Q. of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Princeſſe Royal, and the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> deſcended into the Bark which was to bring them back again to Land. All the Artillery of the Fleet ſaluted thoſe Royal perſons, and the Battery on the <hi>Downes</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> anſwered them with the ſmall ſhot of the Citizens and Guards. It was about four in the afternoon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23. of <hi>May</hi> that the Fleet did ſet ſail, and about ſix a Clock it was gotten ſo far off, that the people which all this while ſtir'd not from the <hi>Downes,</hi> having loſt ſight of it retired themſelves, whileſt the King continued his way towards his Kingdomes, with the ſame Serenity that was ſeen lately to accompany all his affairs.</p>
            <p>Thus ended theſe <hi>Dutch</hi> Triumphs, which while the King remained there poſſeſſed the minds of all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55537:67"/>men, who could not chuſe but ſtand at gaze to ſee the ſtupendious alteration of his condition. His often and familiar reſidence amongſt that people, procured their univerſal love; the ſudden glories of his unexpected Reſtitution, rendred him their veneration and general reverence. They are, what ever their enemies ſay to the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Reaſons of ſtate ſometime have made them recede from the direct wayes of Juſtice, the moſt open hearted people in the world for the generality, ſo that one may reade their thoughts in their countenance; And next to <hi>England,</hi> it may be preſumed they ſhared as much felicity and joy and as truely manifeſted it as any other Nation whatſoever.</p>
            <p>That which in the Kings reſidence there, as was ſaid, poſſeſſed their minds then, now altogether employed their Tongues in relating the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous providences and as propitious Grandeurs of this Monarch. Extolling his virtue and Fortune, with the ſame elevation of diſcourſe, as a Prince every way ſutable to thoſe great Honours and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities which heaven had ſo graciouſly reſerved for him. And theſe ſpeeches were uttered with ſuch paſſion and rapture, and ſo concerningly, as if they had <hi>Denizond</hi> themſelves his natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The unmatchable, and incomparable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glory of this Prince, to be equally belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own and other Nations; while we had the Fruition and enjoyment, and they nothing but the amiable Idea and Platonick affection for his Perſon and Government.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55537:68"/>
            <p>They blamed their Eyes that they were ſo ſhort ſighted they could ſee him no longer, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of our Fleet, not for the injuries and loſſes they had cauſed them in War, but for this done them amidſt ſo much joy, tranquillity and peace; they quarrelled the largeneſſe of the Ocean that had ſo far divided and diſtanced the two ſhores, in hindring them the content of ſeeing the continuation of their begun wonderments, for the King, that they might pleaſe themſelves in the Aemulation of his Subjects. How oft did they envy <hi>Dover</hi> the reception of that Soveraign gueſt, whom they could detain no longer in view! Reaſon as well as their former joy and gladneſſe reſtrained them from ſighing leſt thereby they ſhould fill and ſwel thoſe Sails which winged away their <hi>delight</hi> too faſt, complayning even of their farewell Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
            <p>They then returned drooping, dejected to ſuch a depth of Melancholly, as if they had come from a Funeral, though the Sea never laboured under ſuch a Triumph: when again at their return to thoſe bleſſed ſhades of his abode, joy get uppermoſt again, <hi>floated and ſwimming</hi> in full Bowles and Healths for his <hi>Happy voyage</hi> as if they would <hi>waft</hi> him over in <hi>Veſſels of Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The remainder of that day and night was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated <hi>Carolo Reduci,</hi> the vicine places to the <hi>Hague</hi> reſounding with the like cryes, <hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55537:68"/>with him, that they might make ſure there ſhould be no diſturbance by ſtormy weather, the Gods ſupt upon the ſmooth Table of the Sea, and nothing reeled but the people on ſhore.</p>
            <p>Leave we the <hi>Dutch</hi> to dream of their paſt felicity, and return to the Fleet which was as beforeſaid, under Sail for <hi>England,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being Admiral now commanded. By his order the ſeveral perſons of quality were allotted and diſtributed to ſeveral Ships; And becauſe of the uncertainty, it was not thought fit to entruſt ſo rich and valuable a prize as the Royal Fraternity in one though never ſo firm a bottome, therefore the Duke of <hi>York</hi> diſpoſed of himſelf aboard the <hi>London,</hi> a Ship newly built of the third Rank, of a moſt excellent Fabrick and Compoſition and which for it's Name ſake his Highneſſe was pleaſed to honour, and to continue it's own happy appellation; having received it (after all the infamous places for the late Kings defeats had been adopted into the Fleet) when there was ſome apparency of the Kings Reſtitution, to which this City cheifly and primarily contributed, and ſo happened to be the firſt Chriſtian Ship in the Navy.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> by his Highneſſe order was likewiſe ſet on board the <hi>Swiftſure,</hi> which Name he himſelf changed into <hi>James,</hi> with the uſual Solemnities and Cuſtomes. Nothing was now heard and ſeen at Sea, but the noiſe and the ſmoke of the Cannon, which inceſſantly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55537:69"/>thundred all the remaining part of that day, and continued in great meaſure all the voyage. 'Twas no little part of the Triumph to ſee ſo brave a Fleet in all it's glories ſailing together, which King <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved of a ſingle Ship to be one of the moſt ſatisfactory ſights. The Lord of the Ocean now kept his Court upon it in all his Regalities, and gave Law to it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Flouds; ſuch a calm being thereon that it was an eaſie obſervation to praeſage from thence the evenneſſe, quietneſſe, and ſtability of his Majeſties future Reign and Empire.</p>
            <p>Here we may not omit which hath paſt us in its place, a particular Narrative of the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Letters from his Majeſty and his Highneſſe the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> by General <hi>Mountague</hi> then in the <hi>Downs,</hi> where at the reading of them the Commanders of the ſeveral Ships ſtood up bare and reſolved <hi>nemine Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicente,</hi> That the Commanders and Officers of the Fleet do receive the gracious Declaration of his Majeſty as alſo the expreſſion of his gracious purpoſes to them and the whole Fleet, communicated in a Letter to the General, with great joyfulneſſe of heart, and for them return unto his Majeſty their moſt humble thanks, declaring and proſeſſing their exact Loyalty and Duty to his Majeſty, and deſire the Generalls of the Fleet humbly to preſent the ſame to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe reſolved, that the ſaid Letter, Declaration and Vote ſhould be publiquely
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55537:69"/>read to the reſpective Companies of the Fleet, now in the <hi>Downs,</hi> to know their ſence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, which being accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they did by loud acclamations, and other expreſſions of joy, declare their aſſent to the ſaid Vote, not one perſon in the whole Fleet manifeſting their diſſent thereunto.</p>
            <p>The General fired the firſt Gun himſelf, and cryed <hi>God bleſſe His Majeſty.</hi> Then might you ſee the Fleet in her pride, with Pennants looſe Guns roaring, and Caps flying, and loud <hi>Vive le Roy's</hi> ecchoed from one Ship to another, which were anſwered with the great Guns from <hi>Deal</hi> and <hi>Sandwich</hi> Caſtles. The General en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the Officers, Gentlemen, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners in his Ship with two Pipes of Canary.</p>
            <p>Thus as God turneth the Heart of the King as the Rivers of water, ſo did he turn the heart of thoſe that dwell upon the waters to the King. The ſtrong Stream and Tyde of Loyalty influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſuperiour motions, returned with an overflowing exceſſe of Gladneſſe, and bleſs'd theſe Iſlands with a deluge of joy. Even thoſe very men who ſo lately had declared againſt Monarchy, and His Majeſty in expreſſe terms, and ſtemm'd the Current of duty, now winded about of a ſudden to their Allegiance. They who had been driven with the ſeveral Eurocly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and various Guſts of the Uſurpation, were now led by the fair Gales of the Trade wind of Loyalty; that Loadſtone, that after the many variations in the Compaſſe of our late revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55537:70"/>attracted the Hearts of the moſt obdure, obſtinate and rude people, fixing them in a due courſe by the benigne guidance of a more auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Cynoſure, Great <hi>CHARLE</hi>'s Native Star.</p>
            <p>The Depths of thoſe profound pretences of Liberty, and the Honour of the Nation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly challenged to be debaſed by Monarchy, and ſwallowed up in the Prerogative, were now found to be meer ſhallowes and quickſands; whereon the Veſſel of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> was ready to be Shipwrackt, and nothing but the Soveraign Pilot could ſave or reſcue it, whom the mad ignorance of unruly predatory men had deſperately thrown overboard.</p>
            <p>Nor was it leſſe in the Flexanimity of the Souldiery; the Oracle of the Sword, was now to be fulfilled, in turning it to Plow Shares and Pruning hooks, the Long riddle of the War to be reſolved into a laſting and certain Peace. The great <hi>Alexander</hi> of the North — <hi>qui cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctando reſtituit rem, undid</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> by the <hi>ties</hi> of his diſcreet and temporizing Allegiance. The Obligations, by his Prudence, Worth, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Valour, and Vigilance, which he laid upon the Army, civilized their untamed Spirits, and brought them to a juſt ſenſe of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge of themſelves; the Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical illuſions which had poſſeſſed moſt of them, now the appearance of <hi>Englands</hi> Redeemer was at hand, totally diſappeared, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently return to their innocence (ſuch as miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken duty
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55537:70"/>can be allowed for) in this following Addreſſe to the King, which becauſe of its ſumming up all the Circumlocutions and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the Rebellion, and moſt highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the wonder of the Kings Reſtitution, is here tranſcribed in its own words; it was drawn up while the King was at Sea, and therefore it is placed here, though delivered to Him on <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Heath, May 29.</hi> the day of His En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>

            <p>Something hath been ſaid already, as to the Emblem of the Peace, the Lawyers Cown, but the Law was already reſtored and returned into its ancient Channells and Bounds, the writs iſſuing in His Majeſties Name, and the Courts of Judicature ſetting by His Authority, (the States great Seal having been brought into the Houſe of Commons, and there broke, and the pieces thereof given the Commiſſioners for their Fees) now enſues ſome preparations for the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Sacred Name of the King (like that of <hi>Jehovah</hi> with the Jews) had been not out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, but danger or deſpight, ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver indeed uſed in the Pulpit, it being a pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Crime to mention the King in our prayers, when Curſes and ſpeaking ill of him, though in deſpight of <hi>Solomons</hi> warning again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Pulpit therefore is reconſecrated, which the impudent intruſion and blaſphemy againſt God and the King had profaned; The Purity of Divine Worſhip was to be recommenced with the acknowledgement of the Title and Style of

            <p>The fifth and laſt grand Diviſion, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the aforeſaid Sheriffs Officers alone, who ranked themſelves two by two; the Cities two Marſhals before them, and ſix Trumpets in the Head of them; the whole Body marched up through St. <hi>Laurence Lane,</hi> through <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> up <hi>Cornhill,</hi> down <hi>Grace-Church-Street, Fiſh-ſtreet</hi> Hill, over <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> through the Borough of <hi>Southwarke,</hi> into St. <hi>George's</hi> Feilds; at the <hi>South</hi> end whereof, neer the <hi>Fiſhmongers Colledge,</hi> or Alms-houſe, was placed a Tent for the reception of his Majeſty, and a Chair of State therein by the Lord Mayor, into which his Lordſhip and the Aldermen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and ſtayed, untill intelligence came by the Scout-maſter, that his Majeſty was near at hand.</p>

            <p>In this Equipage the whole Body marched through <hi>Southwark</hi> the ſame way His Lordſhip came, only the Trained Bands of <hi>Southwark,</hi> make a Guard, through which the whole Body paſſe to <hi>London Bridge,</hi> where the <hi>Green</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment are ready on both ſides of the way to receive and guard them by the way, towards <hi>Cheapſide</hi> and <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> all which way a Guard was made on the right hand by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Companies of <hi>London,</hi> in their Rails, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with the ſeveral Banners and Streamers, and on the left, by the other five Regiments of the City Trained Bands.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty and the whole Body being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> are there likewiſe condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> by a Guard of his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Foot, but the Marſhal and Sheriffs officers who conduct the Citizens being come near the <hi>Exchange</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> do open to the right and left, every man placing himſelf before his Leader, and every maniple or Company of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſucceſſively file away, the one to the right, the other to the left, placing themſelves before their Leaders, but the Lord Maiors At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and Aldermen, do file to the right and left, and not face in oppoſition, till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Aldermen terminate at <hi>Whitehal-Gate.</hi>

            <p>And in ſeveral places as he paſſed, in this dayes Triumph, as at the Gate of the Bridge, <hi>Exchange, St. Peters Cheap, Ludgate,</hi> and <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> He was entertained with Wind Muſick; and <hi>Grace Church</hi> Conduit, the four Spouts, <hi>Cornhil</hi> Conduit, <hi>Piſſing</hi> Conduit, <hi>Standard</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> do all run with <hi>Claret Wine</hi> to expreſſe the Cities, and heighten the joy of the Partakers.</p>
            <p>This was the Cities deſignation, and is writ in a ſtyle part as future, and part paſt, becauſe all their intendments did not take effect, but magnificence they aimed at, which in good meaſure, as the ſhortneſſe of the time for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations permitted, they attained. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true and real Triumph of this day, in the whole Progreſſe order and State of it, take in this more exact Tranſcript.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 18 of <hi>May,</hi> His Majeſty came into <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> about 5 of the Clock in the Afternoon, and went immediately into Col. <hi>Gibb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thence he returned to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and about 8 of the Clock ſupped, ſhewing himſelf very courteous and gracious to the Colonel, who preſented to His Majeſty, a very Dutiful Addreſſe, ſigned by himſelf, and all the Officers of his Regiment in behalf of themſelves, and the Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command, which His Majeſty received very graciouſly, and by many expreſſions to the Colonel, gave a teſtimony of his affection to him in particular, and to all the Army in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, of which His lodging with His Royal Brothers in his Houſe, was not the leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. The next morning early Mr. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Clerk,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Swan</hi> both Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this County, received the Honour of Knighthood from His Majeſty.

               </gap>s Majeſty took His journey from <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the <hi>Militia</hi> Forces of <hi>Kent</hi> lining the wayes, and the Maidens in White Waſcoats (which kind of Rural Triumph the City Virgins by a requeſt to my Lord Maior deſired to perform and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55537:78"/>imitate) ſtrewing herbs and flowers in the way he paſſed, and the ſeveral Towns hanging out White Sheets; At the approach of His Majeſty to <hi>Dartford,</hi> the Addreſſe of the Army above mentioned was preſented, and at <hi>Black Heath</hi> the whole Army was drawn up; where His Majeſty received them, giving out many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of His Gracious Favour to the Army, which were received with loud Shoutings and Rejoycings. Several Bonfires were made as His Majeſty came along, and one more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable at <hi>Greenwich</hi> for its bigneſſe (all waves were invented and uſed to expreſſe the Peoples gladneſſe though never ſo uncuſtomary) where the States Arms were burned.</p>
            <p>Thence, the Army being drawn, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, who had come in his Coach to <hi>Suitors Hill</hi> and there took horſe to ſhew himſelf to his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous people, purſued his way towards <hi>London,.</hi> And becauſe God himſelf when he would ſet a mark of obſervance, upon his own Magnalia hath taken notice of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, it was very conſiderable here that it was his Majeſties Birth-day.

All Lets and Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances which have intervened ſince his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties juſt Rights, are now ſo many arguments of his Future fixed and peaceable enjoyment. This the Ancients intimated, when they tell us that <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf was not quiet in heaven,

            <p>When his Majeſty came to St. <hi>Georges-field,</hi> the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen were in a Tent ready to receive him, among whom for the notoriety of the perſon was Alderman <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> once a rude enemy to the King and his Friends, whoſe Company was nevertheleſſe diſſembled, to let the giddy world ſee whoſe Councells and directions they followed, in thoſe late miſerable times; men that could cry <hi>Cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Forrein Ambaſſadors and publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters here reſident, did likewiſe highly expreſs their Joy for His Majeſties happy Arival here on <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt, by their publique Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Plenipotentiaries of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who, in particular, beſides bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires and giving of wine, and throwing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney among the People, made very gallant Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems upon the buſineſſe of the day. That King was <hi>Oliver</hi>'s greateſt Confederate, and this Fire did in a manner purge and Expiate the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Filthy League.</p>
            <p>Thus the King returned to us: Thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed and brought the Bleſſings of Peace and Honour to theſe his diſtracted infamous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; yet the Glory of this his Reſtitution was not <hi>Nobis,</hi> to Us alone, but to the greateſt part of the Chriſtian World beſides. For at this time the Peace in the <hi>North</hi> was Cemented by the Pacification and Agreement between the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55537:81"/>two Kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Sweden;</hi> now queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe conſolidated and firmed for ever, by the indubitable affection and aſſiſtance of this Crown to that of <hi>Denmarke</hi> in caſe of a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If His Majeſty could in the dawn and but glimmering of his Reſtitution, by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to Gen. <hi>Montague,</hi> awe the daring deſign of the <hi>Swede</hi> by ſtanding a Neuter; how much more will he be able to bridle and repreſſe the attempts of that quarrelſome People; when in the greatneſs and height of Power and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion, he ſhall undertake to vindicate his near Ally, for whoſe Intereſts he had ſuch pregnant reſpects as to declare himſelf when his own were <hi>in dubio</hi> and uncertain.</p>
            <p>This was but one Concomitant, ſee a more illuſtrious and moſt Auguſt, which paſſed under the Famous and celebrated Name of a <hi>GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERALL PEACE</hi> between the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe united Ambition preſumed to bleſſe the Chriſtian World with ſuch a Rarity, that was only attributable to the ſingle and ſingular Grandeur of our Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, on whom the Divine Providence was pleaſed to accumulate all thoſe Felicities which through his alone influence, have ever ſince vouchſafed Proſperity to the Nations round about us.</p>

            <p>And becauſe there may happen ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry hereafter concerning thoſe Tranſactions which were concluded in a Marriage betwixt the <hi>French</hi> King and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of

               </hi> which we dive not into, the weakneſſe of our eyes being dazeled and ſcarſe able to behold the apparent luſtre of the publique. The Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereof follows as an aditionall neceſſary ornament and appendix.</p>
            <p>This Treaty between the two Crowns was Commenced about the middle of Summer 1659. when Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> firſt appeared <hi>in Cheſhire</hi> for the King. It had been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in project and deſignation, but cannot be derived ſo far as that of the Kings Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The place of meeting was at a Confine of both Kingdomes; an Iſland called by the name of St. <hi>John de Luz,</hi> on a river which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions, where only the two great Favourites and Miniſters of each Crown met; the Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> and <hi>Don Lewis de Haro;</hi> (His Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> was here himſelf preſent, to conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Affairs in the Treaty, as alſo <hi>Lockhart</hi> from his Maſters at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> under the guard and protection of the <hi>French,</hi> in ſo much danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides privacy he reſided there.)</p>
            <p>Much time it took up in compoſing and ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeverall Pretenſions, when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55537:82"/>was called away by his unqueſtionable and undubitable right (which was adjudged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any praeliminary terms or limitation) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his own Affairs and leave them diſputing theirs, which upon ſecret intelligence and their own judgement and opinion, they perceived would ſo readily advance, as might (if a preſent Concluſion were not made) put both Crowns to new Councels, ſuch as the ſtrangeneſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Revolutions would render very difficult and perplext, if after ſuch a progreſſe either Party ſhould recede; ſo that the King did more than hold the Ballance already.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Mounſieur de Lyonne</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> ſide, and <hi>Don Piementell</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> made many journeys to and fro between both Courts, to haſten the Concluſion of all the preſent Tranſactions. The Biſhop of <hi>Aurange</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe much ſtirred about the ſame; The Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> laboured therein, together with the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Ambaſſador, to whoſe Arbitration, the remaining Differences were at laſt referred.</p>
            <p>Shortly after on the 18. of <hi>May</hi> 1660. the Count of <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> arrived at St. <hi>John de Luz,</hi> bringing all ſatisfaction from his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Majeſty, ſo that all things being regulated between the two Crowns, the Marriage might be celebrated on the 23d. of <hi>May</hi> at <hi>Fontara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> Caſtle, on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated in the 29. of the ſame month.</p>
            <p>Never could any thing fall patter or ſute bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Honour of His Majeſty, whoſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55537:83"/>moſt glorious Birth day it was, and on which he triumphantly entred His Royal City and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London,</hi> where he married himſelf to the affections of his People; ſo that all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this Triumph ſo intended, were but the Handmaids and Attendants of the Kings, whoſe Nativity was to be followed by no leſſe Grandeurs, then the Conjunct reſplendencies of the 2 lately moſt Potent Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the ſame deſignation the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was expected at <hi>Fontarabia</hi> the 22 of <hi>May</hi> and ſeveral dayes after appointed for theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; the 25. the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> was to carry the preſents from the <hi>French</hi> King to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> the 26 the firſt view was to be between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Queen Mother of <hi>France,</hi> the 27. the two Kings were to meet; the 28. the <hi>Infanta</hi> was to be delivered into the Hands of the Queen her Aunt; the 29. her Marriage was to be conſummated. Some of theſe Dayes indeed afterward by ſome caſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> interventions, were altered, but mark how rightly, that Marriage was calculated to that Meridian Star of Glory at the Kings Nativity: take a full account of it as it paſſed.</p>
            <p>On the 23. of <hi>May</hi> about 7. a Clock at Night the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and all the Grandees of his Court, arrived at <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabia,</hi> many Trumpets ſounding before him, and with the Noyſe of all the Canon, and the Shot of the Muſqueteers of that Place, who gave fire above an hour together. In the mean
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55537:83"/>time the ſaid King went into the Caſtle of the Town, prepared before for His Reception, and hung with very rich Arras. Till 9. of the Clock, his Majeſty and his Noblemen refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, being extremely weary of a long march in a very rainy day. About that time his Majeſty called all his Grandees to him, and in their preſence demanded of the <hi>Infanta</hi> her renunciation to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> which ſhe gave very willingly under her hand: on the 24. his Catholick Majeſty came to the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s Lodgings, to let her know that ſhe was to be married that day, deſiring her to be ready about a 11. of the Clock to go with him to the chief Church of that place. About One of clock in the Afternoon, the Biſhop of <hi>Pampelune</hi> being informed that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was a coming, took on him Pontifical Habits, and the Croſſe and the Paſtoral Hook being carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with Muſick, he came to the Church dore to receive his Majeſty, who alighting from his Coach, was conducted by the ſaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop (the <hi>Infanta</hi> being on the Kings left hand both under a Canopy with Curtains on all ſides but that which looked towards the Altar.) The King and the <hi>Infanta</hi> were no ſooner upon their knees, but the Biſhop began a little or low Maſſe which was a very ſhort one: During which the Biſhop of <hi>Frejus</hi> took his place by the Patriarch of the <hi>Indies,</hi> being both the reſpective witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for their reſpective Princes. The Maſſe ended, the Eiſhop put off his Prieſtly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55537:84"/>and took on him the Epiſcopal Robes, and coming down from the Altar, drew near to the Canopy under which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> were.</p>
            <p>All this while <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> was behind the Canopy, but then coming near, and having made a very low obeyſance to the ſaid King and <hi>Infanta,</hi> as Ambaſſador for the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King, he preſented to the Biſhop the Proxy he had of the ſaid King, to marry the <hi>Infanta,</hi> which being read publiquely and accepted of, the <hi>Infanta</hi> fell at the King her Fathers Feet, where after many reciprocal tears for their near ſeparation, that Princeſſe aſſured him of her conſtant and perpetual ſubmiſſion, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Bleſſing, which he gave her with many kiſſes, which notwithſtanding his manly reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, drew again a flood of tears from his Eyes.</p>
            <p>Then the ſaid <hi>Infanta</hi> having given her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Marriage, as well as <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> in the moſt Chriſtian Kings Name, after the uſual words pronounced by the Biſhop, the ſaid <hi>Don Lewis</hi> put a rich ring on the <hi>Infantaes</hi> finger, and the reſt of the Ceremonies being ended, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> looking now upon his Daughter as a Forreign Queen, gave her the right hand and conducted her to her Coach: And entertained her at a coſtly Dinner prepared for that Solemnity.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> was there himſelf <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognite,</hi> and was very much made of by the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55537:84"/>King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who aſſured him of a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Peace and Amity, for a token of which he gave him his Daughter, the preciouſeſt Jewell he had. After mutual Oaths, (for the performance of what they were agreed before concerning that peace and Amity) in ſuch a ſolemn manne: as the like is not to be found recorded, the moſt Chriſtian King retired. <hi>Madamoyſelle</hi> of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was there alſo <hi>incognito,</hi> and very much made of, though no notice taken of her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 25 the Queen Mother with <hi>Mounſieur</hi> the Kings brother, went to the Palace of the Conference, whether the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was to bring his Daughter, himſelf <hi>incognito,</hi> the 3 next dayes the 2 Courts met again, and the perſonal Marriage was made on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 29. the new Queen being brought to the Iſle of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>onference on <hi>Monday</hi> night, in the mean time ſeveral Viſits paſt in private together with ſome publick ones, between the two Kings and Queens; the perſonal Marriage was performed in this manner.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>St. John de Luz</hi> within the <hi>French</hi> Dominions, (the Queen being delivered over, to the French King the Night before) was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this great Solemnity, being adorned with all poſſible Pomp and Bravery. All the Court repaired thither about Noon, by a Bridge made purpoſely from the Queen Mothers Lodgings to the ſaid Church, whereof both ſides were guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55537:85"/>by a double File of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> Guards. The Kings Muſqueteers on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, were in the middle of the place before the Kings Houſe, all in new and rich Caſſocks. The Company of the Archers of the grand Provoſt of the Kings Houſhold went before, then that of the 100 <hi>Switzers,</hi> the Kings foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Pages of the great and ſmall Stables in great number, the Pages of his Majeſties Bedchamber, all in new and magnificent Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſeveral Grandees in black Clothes, with Clokes lined with golden Stuffs and Laces mingled with Embroidery of Gold. Then came along Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> 12. Gentlemen of the Ordinance round about him. After him came the King richly apparell'd, and marching in great Majeſty between the Marquiſs of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillen,</hi> and the Marquiſs of <hi>Humieres,</hi> and 2 Gentlemen of his Chamber on each ſide. The Marquiſs <hi>de Charoſt</hi> Captain of the Guards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him with two of the ſaid Guards. Then came the Queen with her retinue, in the ſame Splendor as before, the Queen Mother next, being led by her Knight of Honour, and one of her Gentlemen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

But all the Triumph, and Honour they could render their Majeſties, together with the Auxiliary ſplendor of the Nobility, came infinitely ſhort of His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain</hi>'s Coronation, and in truth of his Entrance, which had appeared far brighter, had it not been for the Duſt that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all the finery and ſullied the rich Habits that were worn that day.

            <p>Let us now look home to the ſubſequent and remaining Honours of the Kings Reſtitution.

            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers of State and War ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Thankſgiving with no leſſe joy and devotion. After Sermon and after the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates had all dined together they marched from the Councell Houſe to the Croſſe in

After this, was variety of Fire works, ſome burned in the water, others flew into the Air, two Caſtles firing one againſt another, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Boxes thrown into the Air, and falling in

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55537:91"/>by affording them His Royal preſence. At the upper end of the Hall in the Huſtings, towards the Weſt, was raiſed 3. aſcents, where was placed a Chair of State, and a rich Canopy, where His Majeſty and His two Royal Brothers dined, His Majeſties Servants, and ſeveral Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-councel men giving attendance.</p>

            <p>After Dinner was a very coſtly Banquet, and then an Enterlude, where a Ruſtick was repreſented to the Content of His Majeſty, and the reſt of the Spectators.

            <p>For a remark of this happy revolution may we add a relation of unqueſtionable cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, which came to hands ſoon after.

About this Houſe and Town were many Aſh-trees, where on many thouſand Rooks did conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breed; but when the late troubles began about twenty years ſince, all the Rooks quitted the place, which had been their conſtant Habitation Winter and Summer for above three hundred years, and were never ſince diſcovered there abouts till the end of <hi>April.</hi> 1660. about the time of the Kings reſtauration; at which time many thouſand Rooks came again to the ſame place, though the Trees were moſt of them cut down, where for want of Boughs to reſt on, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part ſate upon Hedges and banks of Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſpreading themſelves upon the Mole hills: whereof all the Countrey took notice, and remembring when they fled, concluded their return to be an auſpicious preſage of the bleſſed Turn that immediately followed. The like of this happened elſe where ſo that hereafter theſe Rooks ſhall be the <hi>Bonae Aves</hi> and ſacred onely to Majeſty and Empire.</p>
            <p>Nor may another more rational piece of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55537:94"/>Honor be omitted here; the Royal <hi>Exchange</hi> of <hi>London</hi> had been deprived and forſaken of one of its Tutelar Angels,

            <p>Thus that which by malicious and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cruelty, and diſloyal impotent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, was ſown in diſhonour, roſe again to the ſublimeſt pitch and attainment of Honour; highly indeed glorious, to the memory of theſe renowned <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> to their families, and grateful to good men, but infinitely redevable to the felicity of the times, and his Majeſties moſt juſt Government, yet further moſt ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to his perſonal reflections and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55537:103"/>conſiderations of the ſufferings of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, reſtoring them with himſelfe, making his reſtitution their reſurrection. The powerful juſtice of his Scepter revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſleepy Aſhes of his Subjects, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with them the miracle of his own never enough admired reſtauration.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to add, that thoſe Noble perſons were lighted to their Tombs, by the funeral fires of the Covenant; that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander and Incendiary, whoſe cold Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern conſtitution had endured the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames of a terrible war, could not abide the glowing <hi>aſhes</hi> of theſe <hi>Heroes,</hi> but expired in a hiſſing and ignominious blaze, by the hand of the common Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Let us now leave theſe two Laureats, and at a nearer view contemplate the like revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſcency in another pair of Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Charles Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle</hi> reinterred at <hi>Colcheſter.</hi>
               </note> as famous in their ſtations and places, Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> who were murdered as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and by his Majeſties ſpecial command, with all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming ſolemnity, reinterred in the ſame Town, on the ſame day, 13 years they firſt took up Arms in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being the 7th of <hi>Iune</hi> 1661. On that day the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Train-bands, met at one of the clock in the afternoon, where appeared three hundred compleatly armed. The
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55537:103"/>Coffins were brought to the Houſe of Mr. Recorder <hi>Shaw,</hi> a Member of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, being the place into which the Corps of theſe two Knights were firſt brought after they were ſhot and ſtripped. About three in the afternoon, the Trained Bands being come, they firſt marched in the military manner cuſtomary at Burials, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them marched Mr. <hi>Thurſton</hi> who carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guilt ſpurs upon a black ſtaff; after him a gilt Sword and a velvet Scabbard born by that valiant and Loyal Captain <hi>William Harris</hi> an Officer under Sir <hi>Charls Lucas</hi> from the beginning of the Warr, the Gantlet carried by Mr. <hi>Thomas Tolcott,</hi> the Helmet by Mr. <hi>Andrew Fromartel,</hi> the Breaſt by Mr. <hi>Iohn Robinſon,</hi> and the Back by Mr. <hi>Iohn Merrydale.</hi> Then Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> his Eſcutchion was born by Mr. <hi>Thomas Puſe,</hi> and another for Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> then two led Horſes covered with mourning, after them two Trumpets, and then Mr. <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> who preached the funeral Sermon, attended by two Clergy-men, one on each ſide. Then followed Sir <hi>Charls Lucas</hi> his Coffin carried upon ſix Pikes tyed with match, born by Captain <hi>Street,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maſen</hi> Mr, <hi>Wigs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Soams</hi> in mourning, all of Sir <hi>Charles</hi> his own Regiment, and the Pall ſupported by 6, <hi>viz.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55537:104"/>the County, each of them attended by an Officer bare-headed. Then followed three Clergy-men more, and after them Sir <hi>George Liſle's</hi> coffin carried as the former upon pikes by four of his Officers in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his Pall born by ſix proper Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, each of theſe having an Officer bare-headed attending them. After the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins was born the great Mace of the Town covered with black Cypreſs: then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their black Gowns the Deputy Maior and the Recorder; (the Maior being out of Town) then all the Aldermen, with the Chamberlain, Town-Clerk, Aſſiſtants and Common Council in their Gowns ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with at leaſt ten thouſand Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Inhabitants of the County and Town. In this manner they marched through the chief ſtreets of the Town to St. <hi>Gyleſes Church</hi> (who ſhall hereafter be a Patron for the martyr'd as well as the maimed, for in a Church conſecrated to that Saint, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montreſs</hi> was buried as juſt now we ſaw) the place of interrment for the family of the Lord <hi>Lucaſſes.</hi> After Sermon there Mr. <hi>Layfield</hi> made a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55537:104"/>Arms went down in the Vault, the Drums beating a march until they came out, and then the Musketeers gave three great Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, concluding the ceremony with ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bells in all the Churches of the Town.</p>
            <p>And now leaſt any of theſe ſcattered rayes, and refractions of this Monarchs Glory ſhould be dimmed or disappear in the obſcurity of time, we will tranſlate them to their bright Orb (as <hi>Jupiter</hi> is feigned to have ſtellified his <hi>Heroes</hi>) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle them in the <hi>Diadem,</hi> eternize them in that ſpherical figure, and fix them in his <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>FIRMAMENT</hi> of his paſt, preſent, and future greatneſſe: the Celebrity of which action is not leſſe due to the intrinſick matter, then to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beauteous form, it being not ſo much an exceſſe of pomp, as a Boundary of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, not ſo much height of Glory, as profoundneſs of State-reaſon, &amp; in that large capaciouſneſs may juſtly paſs for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation and perfect excellence of all Regal felicity. This, was the Crown pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned by the lewd hands of thoſe proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Members at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> when the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia</hi> were ſeiz'd on by them, and by <hi>H.</hi> M. his advice, thought fit to be <hi>alienated</hi> to the publique, that is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among the Uſurpers.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55537:105"/>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, when its Gold turned pale and lay covered in the ruine, the duſt and aſhes of three miſerable and mourning Kingdoms.

This was that Crown which the malignity of a dire pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence had envied the fight and bleſſing thereof to the City of <hi>London</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties imperial Chamber (which ſadly felt the other plagues of War and Want in a more forcible abſence of it thereafter) at his Royal Fathers inauguration, and was now Boded and beſpoke with the like contagion, when never were the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Heaven more curiouſly propitious, the two Serene days of that Solemnity, exſiecating and exhaling theſe vapors which a long moiſture to the danger of a Flood did ſeem to portend. Laſtly this was that Crown, whoſe juſt and ancient deſcent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whichder we have flouriſhed ever ſince we

            <p>HIs Majeſty on the twenty ſecond of <hi>April</hi> early in the morning paſſed from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to the <hi>Tower</hi> by water, from thence to goe through the City to <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> there to be Crowned.</p>
            <p>Two dayes were allotted to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this great and moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Action,

            <p>Then his Majeſty roſe out of his chair and by thoſe two that before aſſiſted him was led
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55537:113"/>up to the Communion Table where he made a Solemn Oath to obſerve thoſe things he had before promiſed. After this Oath the King returned to his chair, and kneeled at his foot-ſtool, while the Hymne of the holy Ghoſt was ſinging, which ended, the Letany was ſung by two Biſhops.</p>

            <p>In the <hi>Strand,</hi> and through <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> alſo the wayes were gravelled and rayled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guarded on both ſides, with the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bands of that Liberty and City, and his Majeſties two Regiments of Foot, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of his Grace, <hi>The Duke of Albermarl.</hi> and Col. <hi>John Ruſſel</hi> Brother to the <hi>Earl of Bedford</hi> The Houſes were alſo richly adorned with the Carpets and Tapeſtry, and Muſick, (particularly a ſtage of Morrice-dancers at the <hi>Maypole</hi> in the <hi>Strand</hi>) in the ſeveral places all along his Majeſties paſſage.</p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:55537:116"/>
            <p>When his Majeſtie came through <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Barr</hi> into his ancient and native City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Head Bayliff in a Scarlet Robe, and High Conſtable in Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, received his Majeſty with loud muſick, where alighting off their Horſes, and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to his Majeſty, the head Bayliff on behalf of the Dean and Chapter, City and Liberty, ſignified their joyful recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Royal perſon into that Liberty, declaring how much more happy they were then any part of the Nation, in that their Soveraign Lord and King was born within their Liberty, and humbly deſiring his Majeſty to continue his Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſtill to them, whereby that City might ſtill be enabled to do His Majeſty ſervice. When the head-Bailiff had ended his Speech, he and the High Conſtable mounted their Horſes and fell in next after his Majeſties Serjeants at Mace, in which order they attended his Majeſtie to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Infinite and innumerable were the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and ſhouts from all the parts as his Majeſtie paſſed along, to the no leſs joy then amazement of the ſpectators, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held thoſe glorious perſonages that rid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind his Majeſty. Indeed it were in vain to attempt to expreſs this Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it was ſo far from being utterable, that it is almoſt inconceivable, and much wonder it cauſed in Outlandiſh perſons,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55537:117"/>who were acquainted with our late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and confuſions (to the ruine almoſt of three Kingdoms,) which way it was poſſible for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to appear in ſo rich and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a manner?</p>
            <p>It is incredible to think what coſtly cloaths were worne that day, the Cloaks could hardly be ſeen what ſilke or ſattin they were made of for the gold and ſilver la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; Embroydery that was laid upon them: the like alſo was ſeen in their foot-cloathes. Beſides the ineſtimable value and treaſures of Diamonds, Pearle and other Jewels worn upon their backs and in their hats, to omit alſo the ſumptuous, and rich Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of their Pages and footmen, (ſome ſuits of Liveries amounting to fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds;) the numerouſneſſe of theſe Liveries and the orderly march of them, as alſo that ſtately Equipage of the Eſquires attending each Earl by his Horſe-ſide: ſo that all the world that ſaw it, could not but confeſs, that what they had ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was but ſolemn mummery to the moſt <hi>Auguſt,</hi> noble and true glories of this great day,</p>
            <p>In this order the King arrived at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> a good time before the evening, and then retired himſelfe to ſupper, and ſo to his Reſt, to recommence, the next day and to put an end to, this Triumph.</p>
            <p>All the Kingdome over great rejoicing was made by feaſting and other ſhowes as

                  </p>
                  <p>So that at the ſame time that he bended His Arms to Her Majeſties Embraces, he outſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the Aid and Aſſertion of Her People and Country, being alike Love and War power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Militating at one and the ſame time in the Camps of <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> with the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous valour and bravery; to both which, never any Prince had the like Competent Courage and Vertue, the former ſoftning and eſſeminating, the latter roughening and uncivilizing the mind.</p>
                  <p>To the univerſal joy therefore of his People,
<note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Marrying, to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> He ſolemnly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Parliament which he had called by his own Writ on the 28 of <hi>May</hi> 1661, with this His Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Marrying the <hi>Infanta Dona Katharina</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> for ſeveral weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which he had offered to the Lords of His moſt Honourable Privy Council, who generally approved of His Majeſties choice, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation was then tranſubſtantiated into the Thanks of the Kingdome, delivered by the two Houſes to the King upon the ſame account; ſo impoſſible it was for the King even in His moſt natural Actions, whoſe Delight was recompence
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55537:143"/>enough, not to be magnified; to ſuch a degree of Love in his people, that it can be aſcribed to nothing better, then a powerful Sympathy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced on them from His own Love-poſſeſſed Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty and Articles of Marriage were a little before concluded with the <hi>Conde Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco de Mello,</hi> that no ſubſequent alterations by private opinion ſhould derogate from the Prerogative of His own moſt abſolute cleereſt judgement, not to be profaned with common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and accordingly the ſaid Embaſſador took leave of His Majeſty, in Order to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for <hi>Portugal,</hi> with the ratification of the ſaid Treaty of Marriage here; where not long after he arrived, and brought that Court, but primarily and chiefly the Princely Bride, the News thereof, who with Her Majeſtick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Countenance, gave it a ſolemn and ſerious welcome, not touched with thoſe change of paſſions, which by the viciſſitude of pallid and bluſhing looks, diſcover the meanneſſe and inconſiſtency of other Virgin minds.</p>
                  <p>But though ſhe did ſo prudentially and wiſely conceal the joyes of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhe had long nouriſhed for the King;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The News thereof at</hi> Lisbon.</note> yet was Her Royal Brother and Mother moſt openly glad and joyful at the wiſht ſucceſſe of that Affair, which was inſtantly communicated to the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that King, by the Guns from all the Caſtles and Forts thereof, which were Ecchoed

                  </p>
                  <p>Now all things were preparing for the Voyage with ſuch a Hurry, yet glad intentneſſe, as if the Empire of the World had been removing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more commodious Scituation, and the <hi>Dii Gentiles,</hi> were transferring their Altars to be preſent at the Celebration of thoſe Eſpouſals; Such the Prayers, ſuch the devoted Oraiſons, and lifted up Hands, for the Felicity of Her tranſportation.

                  <p>At the ſame the King her Brother, and Mother, with his Nobles and the whole Court, made as Solemn a proceſſion and Cavalcade from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gallantry there preſent aſſiſted, till She arrived at the River ſide (the Golden <hi>Tagus,</hi> whoſe Surface and Bottome

It proved a long winded Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, not was there other way to be rid of its importunity but by diverſion &amp; laveering, which ſo retarded the Voyage that in a Fortnights time they hardly got into the middle of the Bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> where the Queens Majeſty diſpatcht away Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Sir <hi>Th.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55537:145"/>the Voyage; until about the 5 of <hi>May,</hi> with indefatigable working and Skill, the whole Fleet reached the Iſlands of <hi>Scilly</hi> the furthermoſt we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Dominions of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her Arrival had bin every day expected a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before, which cauſed the King to ſend down his only Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Lord High Admiral to attend on Her upon the Coaſt, and to Complement Her in His name; whereupon his Highneſſe haſted to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and on the 11 of <hi>May</hi> attended by the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> the Lord <hi>Berckley</hi> and other perſons of Quality went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the ſtately <hi>Yangh,</hi> a curious Veſſel, with which the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> preſented the King, to coaſt about the iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> to meet Her Majeſty. On the ſame day Sir <hi>Joſeph Douglas</hi> making towards <hi>Portſmouth</hi> with an Expreſſe from Her Majeſty to the King, was met by his Highneſſe the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> 5 Leagues off the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> who commanded him back with him to the Fleet. On <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning about 10. a Clock they diſcovered the Royal <hi>James,</hi> but there was ſo great a Calm that they could not reach the <hi>Royal Charles</hi> till 6 at Evening. No ſooner had the General eſpied his Highneſſe <hi>Yaugh,</hi> but he went out in his Barge to meet him, the Royal Banner being all the while vayl'd till he was aboard: When his Highneſſe came into the Ship, the Soldiers gave three ſeveral ſhouts, and all the great Guns in the <hi>Royal Charles</hi> (which from that time till the Queens
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55537:146"/>
Entrance had been ſilent) proclaimed his Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, after which the ſeveral Ships of the Fleet paid him their Salutes. Being conducted to Her Majeſties Cabbin, he was placed in a Chair on her right hand, where after ſeveral Expreſſions of Joy for Her Majeſties happy Arrival on the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> and having preſented His Majeſties high reſpects to Her, and as exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affection for Her, his Royal Highneſſe took his leave to retire himſelf to his <hi>Yaugh</hi> for that Night, and the next Morning Sir <hi>Joſeph Douglas</hi> was again diſpatched to the King, in the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Company of the ſaid Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> and Earls, and was forced to tide it thence, and ſometime lay at Anchor, and could not reach <hi>Portſmouth</hi> till the Evening, the 13 of <hi>May,</hi> from whence Sir <hi>Joſeph</hi> took Poſt, leaving the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> to make preparation for the Reception of Her Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>That ſame Night the Royal Fleet with the Princely Bride came to St. <hi>Helens</hi> point, the Eaſtermoſt Promontory of the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> almoſt oppoſite to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> from whence, had it not been too bold a venture to hazzard her Majeſty in that narrow Streight of Sea, and in a Night Tide, they might have reached <hi>Portſmouth</hi> the next morning, but making uſe of the day Tide, which ſerved about 10 of the Clock, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 14 of <hi>May,</hi> the Queen landed at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon, where ſhe was received with all poſſible demonſtrations of Honour, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55537:146"/>and Gentry, and Multitudes of <hi>Londoners,</hi> in moſt rich Apparel, and in great numbers waiting on the Shore for Her Landing, and the Maior and Aldermen, and principal perlons of that Corporation, being in their Gowns, and with a Preſent and Speech ready to entertain Her; the Cannons and ſmall ſhot both from round that Town, and the whole Fleet, ecchoing to one another the loud Proclamations of their Joy.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable that at <hi>Southampton</hi> the next Fort Weſtward, two Sturgeons being of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, due to the King, came into that River, and were preſented to the Maior, as His Majeſties chief Officer in that place, who ſent one to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> as a ſmall but auſpicious and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Preſent to Her Majeſty, who was every day expected there, and the other at a Feaſt was diſtributed amongſt his Brethren of that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The good people of that place, taking them as happy Prognoſticks (being Male and Female) of that bleſſed Union of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, by a Princely Increaſe of Iſſue to ſucceed them.</p>
                  <p>The King having received the Expreſſe of His Queens Landing, prepared to be gone forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to ſalute Her upon Her Arrival, but His great Affairs of State, and Bills to be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Him into Acts of Parliament, which were not quite ready for His Royal Aſſent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed Him at <hi>Whitehall</hi> till <hi>Monday</hi> night the 19 of <hi>May,</hi> having ſent before Him the Biſhop of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55537:147"/>
                     <hi>London,</hi> who departed on the 17. in Order to the Solemnizing of the Marriage.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty having ſigned all the Acts, which are now ſo many wholſome and good Laws, as no age of our Fore-fathers can boaſt of to adorn and honour His Queens Arrival, poſted away at 9 a Clock that Night, with His ordinary Guards, in the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Coach, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with Him only, to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> where he came ſoon after 10. and at the end of that Town entred into the Earl of <hi>Cheſterfields,</hi> there ſet ready for Him, and the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Guards to attend Him, and came before 12 at Night to <hi>Guilford,</hi> being 25 miles, where He lodged that Night, and next morning poſted with the ſame ſpeed to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where He arrived about Noon, to the mutual Joy and Content of His Royal Self and Conſort.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe of Her indiſpoſedneſſe, which yet held Her in Her Chamber, the King ſatisfied Himſelf by giving Her a Viſit in private that day and then withdrew to His own appartiments, much reſenting the diſtemper She was in by Her long paſſage for His ſake, which He moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately ſignified to Her, and made appear to all Perſons attending on Him by His Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and retired Comportment.</p>
                  <p>Yet it pleaſed God to reſtore Her Majeſty to ſuch a degree of Health, that She was able to go abroad, to Conſummate the Marriage Rites, which were performed in the Church of that Town, <hi>Wedneſday May</hi> 21. by the Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55537:147"/>Father in God, <hi>Gilbert</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> according to the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> after which the Nuptials were concluded by His Majeſties Bedding His moſt Excellent Lady that Night in this His Town of <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Reader ſhall now expect Her Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I may ingenuouſly and juſtly enough chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ableſt Pen with a <hi>quis ſufficit?</hi> Flies cannot catch Eagles; Her ſoaring and Excelſe Vertues, ſurmounting all Eſſayes of Flight or Purſuit after them, ſo that no quill can trace or diſcover their Altitudes; Let me invite only your preſent admiration, and future Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Felicities which attend them, to be their competent and illuſtrious Expoſitors.</p>
                  <p>Their Majeſties having thus celebrated their Rites of <hi>Hymen,</hi> for the better perfecting that Health ſo happily reſtored to the Queen, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtay a little time longer in that Town, in which Interim, Viſits were given to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who came over with the Queen, by all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords and Ladies, and by them again returned, until the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Gourt next Week to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> thence to <hi>Farnham,</hi> to <hi>Windſor Caſtle,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> where their Majeſties took up the moſt part of this Summer 1662, as well for the Salubrity as Majeſty of the place, being the moſt abſolute, compleat, and magnificent Structure of all the Royal Palaces.</p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:55537:148"/>
                  <p>But that which is the moſt eminently great, and gives the matchleſſe Honour to this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is the great acceſſion that is made to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in point of Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, beſides the Treaſure and Territory we poſſeſſe as this Ladies Portion. We have firſt an open Navigation into moſt part of the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> where the <hi>Portugal</hi> is more potent then the <hi>Dutch,</hi> having ſeveral Kingdomes there, the principal thereof is that of <hi>Goa,</hi> where for the Security of our Trade, and other Conſiderations of State, we have by this time ſeveral Forts that Command the Country delivered to ſome <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Forces ſent thither lately in a Fleet by His Majeſties Command, ſo that the Company trading thither, will receive notable advantages to the thruſting out the <hi>Hollander</hi> from His Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Ambition of managing ſolely the Wealth and Riches of the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> they are poſſeſt of <hi>Braſilia</hi> from whence in 1654 they valiantly expelled the ſaid <hi>Dutch,</hi> a place of good Traffique, and now free to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marchant, from whence are brought Commodities of good value. But the chiefeſt place of Importance is the City of <hi>Tangier,</hi> ſeated by the Mouth of the Straights of <hi>Gibralter</hi> on the <hi>Africk</hi> ſhore, which ſerves not only to bridle and repreſſe the Piracies of thoſe Dens of Thievery, <hi>Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis,</hi> and the reſt, by being of neceſſity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to paſſe in ſight, when they venture into the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, through that Straight, but alſo
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55537:148"/>if occaſion be, will be of ſame benefit and commodionſneſſe as the <hi>Sound</hi> is to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as through which no Ships of what Nation ſoever, trading into the <hi>Levant,</hi> can paſſe or repaſſe without his Majeſties leave, if he ſhall pleaſe to keep ſome ſhips to that purpoſe in that Harbour.

                  <p>The Queen received the Addreſſes of all the Nobility, and Submiſſions of the ſeveral Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the Cities of <hi>England;</hi> more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Lord Maior &amp; Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> who by Sir <hi>William Wylde</hi> their Recorder, (who pronounced a Spaniſh Oration) preſented Her with a Purſe of Gold.</p>

                  <p>No leſſe great was the Conflux to this Palace from all parts of the Kingdome then at His Majeſties Coronation.

                  <p>It was imagined Her Majeſty would have made Her entrance by a Cavalcade through <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> from the <hi>Tower,</hi> or through <hi>Southwark</hi> and ſo over the Bridge, while the Triumphall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were yet ſtanding. But it pleaſed the King to order it otherwiſe, and to honour Her Acceſſe to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with a new and unuſual, though as magnificent a Reception as had any of His Royal Progenitors; that as the Queen had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun ſo She might finiſh her Princely Adventure by water, on thoſe Soveraign and Amorouſly combining Streams of <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Iſis,</hi> whoſe Floods haſtening to the Sea to tell the News of Her coming, ſwell'd back again with ſuch a full Current and Spring, (the Brittiſh Marine Gods and Nymphs with all their Train ruſhing in to behold and Welcome Her to Her Home) that their Banks were overflowed, while neglecting their Bounds, they ſtopt Her Barge and gazed on the Sight, with a long and ſteady view. The Order of that Triumph in brief was after this manner.</p>

               <p>In this order by 7 a Clock their Majeſties reached <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and at the inſtant of their Landing, were ſaluted with two Tire of Artill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery placed on both ſides the Water, and which concluded with their loud Muſick, thoſe harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Conſorts of other leſſer Inſtruments, which every Barge of the Companies was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with, as Trumpets, Hoboyes, Flutes, Waits, Viols, and Violins, to the great delight and ſatisfaction of the Spectator, and to the ample decoration of this Magnificence, which paſſing along the murmuring and trembling Waves, was highly advantaged in the reſounds and quavering Ecchoes reverberated from thoſe pleaſant Depths.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:55537:155"/>
               <p>When thoſe Guns ceaſed, the Tower began the teſtimonies of its Gladneſſe, by the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, and continued it till night called upon the officious day (which was the only dry one of a whole fortnight preceding) ſuch his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſerene and ſure influence) to cloſe his cheerful eyes, and reſt from his illuſtrious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; while ſhe employed her <hi>emulous</hi> viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in ſutable demonſtrations of her joy, ſuch as Bonfires, Fireworks, and the like <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> which her <hi>Blacks</hi> only could <hi>commend</hi> and <hi>ſet off</hi> to the ſight.</p>
               <p>I have omitted all the Speeches, but one, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this days ſervice, becauſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty heard but that one, and but part of that alſo, by reaſon of the miſguided interpoſition of the Companies between the Pageants (very few whereof their Majeſties had the full ſight, by reaſon of thoſe Confuſions cauſed by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Boats and Barges, ſo that the <hi>Thames</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bore the like burden for weight and value being covered from one bank to the other) (the ſaid reſpective Companies doing their civilities to the Queen, by waving their hats out of the Bails of their Barges as ſhe paſſed by them) But I refer the Reader to their proper place being Printed at large, where the whole Menage of this Affair at the Cities charge is fully deſcribed, being intituled <hi>Aqua Triumphalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somewhile before this their Majeſties coming to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> arrived that moſt incomparable Lady for Piety, Prudence, and conjugal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55537:155"/>the Queen Mother, the mournful Relict of our late Martyr'd Soveraign, intending here to repoſe that <hi>half</hi> ſurviving part of her dear Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and to integrate and make entire the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Remains by her Preſence, to the completion of his Majeſties Felicity; whoſe Imperial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily may indulgent heaven enlarge by as ſwift and ſudden accrument, as it did in its diſpleaſure lately retrench it.</p>
               <p>The Place of this moſt Excellent Princeſſes Reſidence, her Palace and Mannor of <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> importunely directs me to an obſervation well becoming this diſcourſe; and that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Survey of its preſent glory (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to it with other its Siſters, as <hi>Somerſet-Houſe, Nonſuch-Houſe,</hi> and ſome few elſe) from the level of its deſigned neer ruin and Demolition. The anxious Genii and Penates of theſe places, no doubt did highly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly operate in the Confuſion and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the late ſeveral Uſurpers; when to ſave their ſeats and reſcue their Altars, they power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully intermedled betwixt the Ambition and Covetouſneſſe of the Rebellion, equally avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proſtitution and Sale of the Multitude, and the rape of a ſingle Tyrant, while they ſtood as the prize of eithers atchievement upon the other, like the golden Apple of ſtrife and diſcord, betwixt both Competitors. They have now together with his Majeſties fortune reſumed their Grandeurs, and have reared up their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted heads, — and as <hi>Nero</hi> once ſaid of his
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55537:156"/>capacious and glorious Edifice, <hi>nunc incipiunt habitare;</hi> they do but now begin to dwell.</p>
               <p>I muſt paſs over many other ſplendid remarks, (purpoſely omitting thoſe ſeveral entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; gratulations given to their Majeſties by the Nobility upon the account of this welcome.) that perſue my Pen, and do juſtly vindicate their place in this Regiſter. Such is the late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into <hi>Portugal</hi> of that Army, under the Command of that famous Captain the Earl of <hi>Inchequin,</hi> whoſe Glories challenge a Sphere to themſelves, for who raiſes not up his Spirit at the reducing of his <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſervice though but to his mind &amp; memory? Such is the reducing the Courts of Judicature to their Ancient Seats in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall,</hi> from whence by the novelty of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they had been baniſhed, to give place to their bloody High Court of Injuſtice, whoſe deteſtable memory ſhall be its only record, while the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Law ſhall triumph in its priſtine Reſidence. Such thoſe celebrated additions of State and Pleaſure to His Majeſties Palaces of <hi>White-hall</hi> and St. <hi>James's,</hi> that have deſervedly fam'd a Panegyrick. Such is that <gap reason="foreign">

In the quiet and undubitable fruition whereof, and as the moſt certain and infallible Pillar and firm ſupport of theſe his temporal Felicities, and as the earneſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55537:156"/>glory of thoſe eternal to come, I leave our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign, as knowing nothing <hi>BETTER</hi> or <hi>GREATER</hi> can be ſaid of <hi>HIM.</hi>
